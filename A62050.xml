            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I did not think my ſelf a little bound to that Providence, which gave you Relation to our Pariſh; and I ſuppoſe not without cauſe, when the power of godlineſs hath few ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Patrons.<note place="margin">There is ſcarce one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, <hi>cui praeſens fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticitas ſi arriſit, non irriſit.</hi> Bern. lib. 2. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolat.</note> Men of your rank, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (to ſtop the mouth of conſcience, or for their credit) they take up a form and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, yet do uſually neglect, if not curſedly deride the ſtrictneſs and power of Religion.

You know who hath ſaid, <hi>Not many ſuch are called, 1 Cor. 1.26.</hi> And experience teacheth us, that they are like Stars of the firſt Magnitude thinly ſcattered in the Firmament of a Country. How much therefore are you engaged to that diſtinguiſhing love, which enableth you to look after the things of a better life!</p>
            <p>I ſhall take the liberty (which I know you will give) to ſpeak a few words to you in your twofold capacity.</p>
            <p>Firſt as you are a Chriſtian; and herein my counſel will be, that you would more and more enſure your effectual calling. We ſay, where men intend to live long, they build ſtrong. I am confident all that you are worth, for your endleſs condition in the other world, dependeth under Chriſt upon your inward change. And if ever any wyers had need to be firm and ſtrong, then queſtionleſſe they upon which ſuch heavy weights hang, as your eternal unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eſtate.</p>
            <p>You have a large room in the hearts of many that are holy: But alas Sir, the beſt mans confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of me would prove but a bad evidence for heaven: He is not approved whom man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth,
<pb facs="tcp:38111:4"/> but whom the Lord commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>The great affection which you bear to the ſouls of the people, amongſt whom you were born, is worthy of imitation: And ſo is your care and coſt in ſcattering ſome practical home-treatiſes in ſeveral families (whereby ſouls may be converted, and wherein you may have comfort at the day of Chriſt) for ſoul-charity is the ſoul of charity; but the beſt charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at home, though it never ends there; your main buſineſs lyeth within your own doors, to make ſure that good work within you, which ſhall be perfected hereafter.</p>
            <p>The ordinary ſecurity which moſt men truſt to, will not ſerve when they come in the other life, to lay their claims, and ſhew their deeds for the inheritance of the Saints in light. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny flaws will then be found in their evidences, which now through their wilful blindneſs they neither ſee nor fear.<note place="margin">Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The
<pb facs="tcp:38111:4"/> want of this is the leak which ſinketh many a precious veſſel (ſoul I mean) in the gulph of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>There is as much difference between a nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and a real Chriſtian, as between a liveleſs picture and a living perſon. True Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which conſiſteth in the ſouls humble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained acceptation of, and hearty reſolved de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication unto Chriſt, as Saviour and Soveraign, is a Paradox to moſt. There are many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (as <hi>Salvian</hi> complained in his time) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt,<note place="margin">Chriſtiani ſine Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto.

The Moraliſt in his beſt dreſſe of civility, the Formaliſt in his gaudy attire of ceremonies, and the hypocrite in all his royalty, is not arrayed like one of theſe. I do not write theſe things as in the leaſt ſuſpecting your ſincerity, but to quicken you to a godly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie over your own ſoul. If the Apoſtles and Diſciples needed ſuch rouſing cautions, <hi>Take heed leaſt that day come upon you unawares, Luke 21.34.

And indeed if my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and
<pb facs="tcp:38111:11"/> night (though every tear were a tear of blood) I could never ſufficiently bewail the ſlain of the daughter of my people, of that Pariſh to which the providence of God hath called me.</p>
            <p>That the lying vanities of this world ſhould by moſt be ſo greedily purſued, and the reall mercies relating to a better world, ſo wretchedly deſpiſed: that a brutiſh fleſh, which muſt ſhortly be food for wormes, ſhould be ſo highly prized, and conſtantly gratified; and an angelical ſpirit, the ſoul which muſt live for ever, ſo baſely ſlighted and unworthily neglected: that every ſoul-damning luſt ſhould be ſo heartily embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and the ſoul-ſaving Lord but coldly and complementally entertained: that the road to Hell ſhould be ſo exceedingly filled, and the way to Heaven almoſt wholly unoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied. Surely this ought to be for a bitter lamentation; and O what ſea of blood is enough to bemoan this horrid wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe!</p>
            <p>It hath ſeemed to me therefore a matter worthy of diligent enquiry, what ſpecial Malefactors ſhould be indicted for theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoul-miſcheifs, and ſoul-murders, which are committed amongſt us. And truly by
<pb facs="tcp:38111:11"/> that acquaintance which I have with the Word of God, and experience of the ſoul-affairs of men, I find, though many Acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries might be named, that ignorance ought to be arraigned and condemned as one of the principals. <hi>The people periſh for want of knowledge, Hoſ.</hi> 4.6, Inner darkneſs is the beaten path to utter darkneſs, to the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of darkneſs for ever. Men in this miſt of ignorance (like ſhips) run upon thoſe rocks which ſplit them eternally.

            <p>What is the reaſon, that ſo many make a mock of ſin, and dance merrily over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal pit, and play with the unquenchable fire, but ignorance? The Child doth not know that the fire will burn him. As the

Did they know what they do, when they wilfully break Gods Law, they would ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er leap into a furnace of ſcalding lead, than provoke ſo jealous a God. But ſin goeth in a diſguiſe, and thence is welcome; like <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> it kiſſeth and kils; like <hi>Joab,</hi> it ſalutes and ſlayes.

            <p>What is the reaſon that men take up ſhort of Chriſt, and renewing grace, that they pleaſe themſelves with the ſhadow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the ſubſtance of Religion, that they cry peace, peace, to their ſouls onely upon ſome outward priviledges or a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good meanings (as they call them) when they are in a moſt damnable condition, and ſuddain deſtruction is ready to ſeiſe on them (as travail on a woman with child) which they cannot eſcape; ſurely it is ignorance of the nature of Chriſtianity and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; they know not what regeneration is, and what faith and repentance are, which are the conditions upon which ſalvation may be had; therefore they reſt in forms (which will fade) when their hearts and lives deny the power of godlineſſe. This, this is (not as Papiſts would perſwade their deluded votaries the mother of devotion, but) the monſter which cauſeth ſuch hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous births of corruption. This is the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical diſeaſe that raigneth all the year long, and killeth (I fear) more ſouls then any of our new diſtempers doth bodies: <hi>For the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God,
<pb facs="tcp:38111:14"/> and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Which ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord and from the glory of his power,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.6, 7, 8, 9.

Alas, alas, We finde by woful experience that there are many, very many Indians and heathen (for ignorance) in <hi>England.</hi> Men and women that know as little of God and holineſs of Chriſt, his natures, offices, of true faith and repentance, as if they had been born, and bred up all their time in Turky or India.

            <p>Reader, To cure this ſoul-murdering diſtemper, I have endeavored (according to the truſt committed to me, and the grace beſtowed on me) to diſcover in this Treatiſe the life in Chriſt, or true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, with the matchleſs endleſs felicity that accompanieth it; as alſo the nature and danger of unregeneracy, with the means to come out of it; by which thou mayſt ſee that many cozen their ſouls with counterfeit coin (falſe evidences for heaven) inſtead of true, which will not abide the touchſtone of Scripture, and ſo like <hi>Uriah,</hi> they carry
<pb facs="tcp:38111:15"/> thoſe letters about them, though they know it not, which will at laſt coſt them their lives, and cauſe their eternal deaths. That there is no fool like the ſinner who ſelleth his ſoul for a ſong; his Saviour, his eternal happineſs, the unſpeakable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures at Gods right hand for evermore, for the periſhing empty profits, and baſe brutiſh pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon; Though ſin be delightful in the act (to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wretches) yet it will be bitterneſs in the end. It will be a bitter-ſweet to all its lovers, when for their momentany pleaſure they ſhall be recompenced with eternity of into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable unconceivable pain. That it is not for nothing that Miniſters call ſo loudly and earneſtly to thee, to kill thoſe luſts which would kill thee, and to follow after holineſs, without which no man ſhall ever ſee the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. It will teach thee, that God and Chriſt, heaven and hell, thy ſoul and eternity, death and judgement are not things to be dallied with; believe it, thou wilt one day find that it is bad jeſting with ſuch edged tools. Surely the greateſt ſeriouſneſs that is imaginable is too too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for them. O hadſt thou but the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part of that ſeriouſneſs about them
<pb facs="tcp:38111:16"/> which they deſerve, and call for at thy hands; ſurely thou wouldſt have other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thoughts of them, and carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them then now thou haſt. Well, I have four ſpecial things at preſent from the living God to commend to thee and leave with thee in order to thine eternal good (I known not how ſoon I may be taken from thee) If thou loveſt thy ſoul, practice them faithfully; if not, anſwer the contrary when thou and I ſhall meet in the other world at the great and terrible day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, do thou labor for the knowledge of God and his Son, thy ſelf, and the duty which thou oweſt to thy Maker and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; haſt thou not read the doleful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ignorance? and doth it not nearly concern thee to get out of that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable condition?</p>
            <p>Without this thou canſt never be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, notwithſtanding all thy pretences that thou meaneſt well, and haſt as good an heart as the beſt. If thou knoweſt not the God of thy fathers, thou canſt never ſerve him with a perfect heart, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. All thy worſhip will be but wild, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering from God; all thy ſervices but the

God expecteth reaſonable ſervices, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. ſuch for which thou canſt give a good reaſon out of his word, which muſt be the warrant of thy worſhip. Be not therefore in ſhape a man, a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as <hi>NebuchadneZZar,</hi> in heart a beaſt; be not as the horſe and mule which hath no underſtanding, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.9.</p>
            <p>Without knowledge thou canſt not be ſaved; If the Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that periſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. Wilful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a ſad ſign that thou art in Gods black bill. If God will ever have thee to be ſaved, he will bring thee to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. When <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> face was covered, his execution was near. Do not delude and deſtroy thy ſoul by preſuming that thy ignorance will not damne thee; for if thou art without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he that made thee will not ſave thee, and he that formed thee will ſhew thee no mercy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.11.

            <p n="3">3. Take heed of ſinning againſt thoſe commands which thou knoweſt: Hold not the truth in unrighteouſneſs; Do not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton away the light, leaſt God give thee up to judiciary darkneſs.

If any man will do my will, he ſhall know my doctrine whether it be of God or no, <hi>John</hi> 7.17. To practice what you know, is the way to know what to practice; Knowledge is the mother of obedience, it breeds it; and obedience is
<pb facs="tcp:38111:18"/> the nurſe of knowledge, it feedeth and nurtureth it; if thou improveſt thy little ſtock well, doubt not but God will adde to it and encreaſe it; leave no means untried for the obtaining this purchaſe. I have (if thou belongeſt to our Pariſh) offered thee to inſtruct thee to my power in the myſteries of Chriſt, appointed alſo days for that end; it may be thou art one of thoſe many that ate too old to learn, that ſcorn to be taught. I would ask thee one queſtion, and think of it, Art thou not too old to be ſaved? Doſt thou not ſcorn to go to heaven? Surely thou doſt; by contemning the way thou ſcorneſt the end. Well take heed thou doſt not die without knowledge; for if thou doſt, all the world cannot keep thee one quarter of an hour out of hell, and then thou wilt have time enough to befool thy ſelf for refuſing a good offer, and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rejecting through thy pride thoſe things which concerned thine eternal peace.

Ah, poor wretches, what comfort would you nave us ſpeak to thoſe to whom God himſelf ſpeaks terror?

O how ſad will it be for thee that art now aſleep in ſin, to

            <p>Beſides, if thou didſt but regard thy own temporal good, thou wouldſt inſtruct thy ſervants and children in ſpiritual things; for they that are unfaithful to their Maſter and father in heaven, will be unfaithful to their maſter and father on earth. They that make no conſcience of their duty to God, but rob him of his ſervice and worſhip, will never make conſcience of their duty to thee, but if they have opportunity, will rob thee of thy time, ſervice, and goods.</p>
            <p>Be ſure that thou performe family duties, as praying, reading, and the like, morning and evening; do not ſerve the fleſh and the world all day, and then put God off with a few cold ſleepy petitions at night; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is, Pray continually, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17.
<pb facs="tcp:38111:23"/> 
               <hi>Daniel</hi> was at it three times a day, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. <hi>David</hi> ſeven times a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.164. Gods mercies are renewed on thee every morning, and ſhould not thy prayers and praiſes be renewed every morning? Doth not the preſervation of thy family every night, deſerve family acknowledgement in the morning? Weariſome nights are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to others; the beds of others prove their graves, thou and thine might have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken in hell; doth this diſtinguiſhing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy deſerve no thanks? Is not thy family every day lyable to many dangers, both bodily and ſpiritual? doth it not need pitying, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying, pardoning, directing, preventing mercy every day, nay every moment? and is not all this worth a prayer? Upon no account neglect the offering up of theſe morning and evening ſacrifices; let thy prayers and of the reſt in the family come up before the Lord in the morning like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and the lifting up of thine hands at night as an evening ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Do not ſay as ſometimes I have heard of thee, that thou canſt not ſpare time for theſe duties, thy family is great, and thou canſt not get them altogether, thy buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is great, and a little time ſpent this
<pb facs="tcp:38111:23"/> way, may wrong thee; I anſwer thee, Canſt thou get all thy family together twice a day to ſet meals for their bodies, and canſt thou not get them together twice a day for ſet meals (family duties) for their ſouls? 2. What greater or weighter buſineſs canſt thou have, then the working out the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy own, and the ſouls committed to thy charge? are not the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affairs thou canſt poſſibly deal about, but toys and trifles to this? 3. Was not <hi>Davids</hi> family greater then thine, and his occaſions weighter? and yet he could find time (though a King) for family duties, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.9. He and his Queen did both inſtruct their child in the things of God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.3. to 10. <hi>Pro.</hi> 31. If thou art poor, and ſaiſt thou art to provide for thy family, ſee an anſwer to that in this book, <hi>pag.</hi> 187.188.189. Though God will give you both another manner of anſwer to your fooliſh pretences, when ye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the judgement ſeat of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Have a ſpecial care alſo of the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day in thy family; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the living God commandeth thee, that thou, thy ſon, thy daughter, thy man-ſervant, and thy maid-ſervant, and all
<pb facs="tcp:38111:24"/> within thy gate keep that day holy. Do not make the ſins of others thine by thy pattern or permiſſion; let not that queen of days be defloured or prophaned by idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, earthly thoughts, words, or actions; ſpend the whole time which thou ſpareſt from the publike Ordinances, in ſecret and private duties, as praying, reading, ſinging, chatechiſing, taking an account of thy children and ſervants, what they know of the myſteries of Chriſt, and particularly what they have learned that day. Eſteem it a ſpecial priviledge, a great mercy, that thou and thine may upon that day ſequeſter your ſelves wholly from worldly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and enjoy communion with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God in the means of grace. This I ſhall be bold to tell thee, that Religion and the ſervice of the moſt high God in thy family, dependeth much, yea very much upon thy obſervation of the Lords day; thou mayſt expect its increaſe or decreaſe according to thy ſanctification or prophanation of it. In the Primitive times when the queſtion was <hi>Servaſti Dominicum?</hi> the anſwer was, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus ſum, omittere non poſſum.</hi> Thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt to be a Chriſtian, make conſcience of every minute of that day of Chriſt. Be
<pb facs="tcp:38111:24"/> ſure that thou and as many of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily as can poſſily be ſpared, attend with all diligence and reverence at the publike place of worſhip; there God receiveth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt praiſes, and there he beſtoweth the choiceſt mercies. O bleſſed are they that dwell in his houſe, bleſſed are they that wait at Wiſdoms gates, that watch at the poſts of her doors, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. In all things ſhew thy ſelf a pattern to them that are under thy care and charge; the peop!e commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thy government, will ſooner imitate thy doings, then obey thy ſayings. Sin cometh in at firſt by propagation, but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed exceedingly by imitation; thou that haſt thy children and ſervants follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee either to heaven or to hel, haſt need chooſe a right path, even the narrow way that leadeth to life. Weigh thy words, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that they will learn thy language; avoid thoſe ſinful expreſſions of Faith and Troth (let your yea be yea, and your nay nay; for whatſoever is more is evil) of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating others oathes, of ſpeaking irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of the great God and his word, of wiſhing evil on any man; for the command is, <hi>Bleſs them that curſe,</hi> Mat. 5.44. let no evil communication proceed out of thy lips,

Look well to thy works, that they be agreeable to the word of God. In thy Religious performances eſpecially manifeſt all reverence, fervency, &amp; ſeriouſneſs, that thy children and ſervants may ſee that thou art in earneſt about ſoul-affairs; about eternity-concernments; thou little knoweſt how profitable ſuch a pattern may be unto them. Do thy utmoſt, uſe all means commanded thee to ſave thy ſelf and them that dwell with thee. Be confident that ſhortly Chriſt will ſay to thee as <hi>Eliah</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> With whom haſt thou left thoſe few ſheep in the wilderneſs? What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the children and ſervants which I intruſted thee with? will it be enough think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou for thee then to anſwer, Lord, For my children, I brought them up without any charge to the Pariſh; or Lord, I bred them Gentlemen; or I put them out to trades, or I left them competent eſtates. And for my ſervants, I paid them their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, gave them their meat and drink, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my agreement with them. When Chriſt ſhall reply (Man) what is become of their ſouls which I created capable of the
<pb facs="tcp:38111:26"/> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate fruition of my ſelf, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with my precious blood? what ſhame will then cover thy face, and what horror fill thy heart, when the blood of their ſouls ſhall be required of thee! O therefore let <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> practice and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be thine, That thou and thy houſe will ſerve the Lord, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Make Religion and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping and glorifying the great God the great buſineſs of thy whole life.

               </note> If all the world were made for man, then man was made for more then the world. All the favors thou enjoyeſt are but baitslaid by God to catch thy ſoul; as they come all from him, ſo let them be improved all for him. It is godlineſs alone that will hold out when thou comeſt to the greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:38111:27"/> hardſhips at the day of affliction and the hour of thy diſſolution. The good man and his godlineſs are like <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> lovely in their lives, and in their deaths they are not divided, therefore exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thy ſelf unto godlineſs. It may be, thou art one to whom God hath given much in the world; I muſt tell thee that much will be required of thee; the greater thy receipts are, the greater thy returns muſt be, and the larger thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements for God; make to thy ſelf friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, that when that faileth, thou maiſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Celeſtial habitation. The way to get that which thou canſt not part with, is by charity to part with that which thou canſt not keep. Thou canct not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thy bags to heaven; it is good to take bills of exchange from the poor, whereby thou maiſt receive there what thou couldſt not carry thither; <hi>Laudent te eſurientium viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera, non ructantium opulenta convivia,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hierom.</hi> It is ſtoried of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given away almoſt all he had, one of his friends asked him where his treaſure was; he anſwered, pointing to the poor, <hi>In ſcriniis,</hi> in his cheſt.

What were it for thee to maintain four or ſix poor children at School, whereby they may come to read, and learn to know the way to life? Doth it not grieve thee to underſtand the groſs ignorance of many! and what do they tell us (when we reprove them for it) that they are not book learned, they could never read! What were it for thee that haſt (poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly) ſeverall hundreds <hi>per annum,</hi> to give twenty pound a year this way? I tell thee that God expecteth more than this for his ſervice; and I am confident thou maiſt have more comfort in ſuch acts of ſoul-charity, than in ten times the value beſtowed on the world and the fleſh. I am ſure God keepeth an exact account how thou employeſt thy revenues; and think of it again and again, what thou wilt do in ſuch an hour, when thou ſhalt ſtand naked at the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, and all thy receipts and disburſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall be declared and mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, Angels, and Men; when <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primis</hi> Pride cometh with her Tailors long bill of ſo many thouſands for new faſhions, fooliſh fancies, or gaudy attire for thee or

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, thou wilt wiſh then, thou hadſt done more for God and his intereſt, and leſs for the fleſh. It was a wiſe ſpeech of <hi>Licon</hi> the Philoſopher (when a wealthy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant bragd to him of the multitudes of his ſhips and furniture for ſea,<note place="margin">Laert.</note> how he was able to trade into all parts) I eſteem not that to be felicitie which hangs upon ropes and cables.

            <p>Whoever thou art, whether poor or rich, make an abſolute dedication of thy ſelf and

            <p n="1">1. Chriſt is the principle of my life. All living creatures have an inward principle by which they live, and according to which they act. Plants have a principle of vegetation,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38111:45"/> beaſts have a principle of ſenſe,<note place="margin">Ad vitam ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem quod attinet, certum eſt adnos deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vari exigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os quoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, ipſum autem fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem in Chriſto la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. in Col. 3.3.</hi>
               </note> men have a principle of reaſon, and their lives are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, anſwerable to their different principles. But a Chriſtian hath an higher principle (that is, Chriſt dwelling in his heart by faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17.) and thence it is that he lives an higher life. As the body liveth by its u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the ſoul, ſo the Chriſtian liveth by his union with Jeſus Chriſt; Chriſt is the fountaine and ſpring of his life, the ſoul of his ſoul, and the life of his life. <hi>I live</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in me, and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Sonne of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the branches, they live, but it is by the root, they derive ſap from it, and ſo live by it: So the believer, he liveth ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but it is by Chriſt, he deriveth the ſap of grace from this true Vine, and ſo liveth by him.</p>
            <p>The water in the Rivers doth not more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Ocean, nor the light in the air upon the Sun, than the life of a Chriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore the Holy Ghoſt telleth us, <hi>He that hath the Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.12.</note> 
               <hi>hath life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not life.</hi>

            <p>I have ſometime read, that the Lioneſs bringeth forth her whelps dead, till after ſome time the lion roareth aloud, and then they live. This is certain, every man and woman is born dead; dead to God, dead in ſins and treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, till this lion of rhe tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his voice; then they ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt giveth them life. When the ſoul (like the body of <hi>Lazarus</hi>) hath been dead ſo long that it ſtinketh and is unſavory, when it hath been many dayes, nay many years rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the grave of corruption, then if Jeſus Chriſt calleth effectually, <hi>Lazarus,</hi> come forth, ſinner come forth of thy carnal unregenerate eſtate: then, and not till then the ſoul hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the voice of the Son of God, and liveth.</p>

            <p>One end of Chriſts incarnation and life in the fleſh, was to ſet an exact pattern for our lives in the ſpirit; He left us an example, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38111:47"/> we ſhoeld follow his ſteps, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>All the actions of Chriſt are inſtructions to a Chriſtian:</hi> His actions were either moral or mediatory; In both the Chriſtian imitates him: In the former, doing as he did, exerciſing the ſame graces, performing the ſame duties, reſiſting the ſame temptations, forbearing the ſame corruptions: In the latter by ſimilitude, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſin, as he died for ſin; riſing to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, as he roſe again to a natural life. None indeed can parallel the life of Chriſt, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry new creature imitateth Chriſt in his life; <hi>he walketh as Chriſt walked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 2</note> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6. The ſame mind is in all the Saints (ſo far as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated) that was in Chriſt, the ſame will, the ſame affections; they love what he loveth; they loath what he loatheth; what pleaſeth him, pleaſeth them; what grieveth his ſpirit, grieveth their ſpirits: As the wicked are like their father the Devil; unholy, as he is unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo the children of Chriſt are like their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Father; holy as he is holy; onely with this difference, in Chriſt there is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in them a meaſure; in Chriſt pureneſs, in them a mixture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>To me to live is Chriſt, i. e.</hi> Chriſt is the comfort of my life; though I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny croſſes, yet I have Chriſt for my comfort:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38111:47"/> He is the comfort of my life, and the life of all my comforts. All my joyes come in at this door, all my contentments come ſwimming in this ſtream.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Piſcator</hi> obſerveth that the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is the Periphraſis of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.25. Becauſe all the conſolation of a true Iſraelite (as <hi>Jacobs</hi> in <hi>Benjamin</hi>) is bound up in Chriſt; if he be gone, the ſoul goeth down to the grave with ſorrow. As all the candles in a Country cannot make a day; no, it muſt be the riſing of the Sun that muſt do it: So all the health, wealth, honours, pleaſures, relations, poſſeſſions, nay the greateſt confluence of comforts, that the whole Creation affordeth, cannot make a day of light and gladneſſe in the heart of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; no, it muſt be the riſing of this Sun of Righteouſneſſe. The light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance cauſeth more joy than all the corn and wine, and oyl of this world can.

            <p>His comfort ebbeth and floweth as Chriſt

All the Rivers run into the Sea; unto the place from whence the rivers came, thither they return again; ſo the life of a Chriſtian coming from Chriſt, muſt neceſſarily tend to Chriſt. A ſincere Saint doth not like the hypocrite, look aſquint at ſelf-applauſe, ſelf-profit, and ſuch beggarly ends, but his eyes look ſtraight on at the glory of Jeſus Chriſt. If Chriſt be glorified, though he be diſgraced, he is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; when Chriſt hath honoured the ſoul by giving it grace, the ſoul honoureth Chriſt by giving him glory.

            <p>Therere are two evils, which are indeed the onely evils (though the firſt is by much the worſt) the evil of ſin, or defilement; and the evil of ſuffering, or chaſtiſement: Now a believer by death ſhall be freed from both theſe.</p>

            <p>If <hi>Ireland</hi> (as ſome write) be ſo pure a ſoyle, that it will not nouriſh any venemous creature; I am ſure heaven is ſo pure, that into it can in no wiſe enter any thing that defileth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>ult.</hi> it will not harbour thoſe poiſnous ſerpents.</p>
            <p>Heaven once (ſaith an Author) ſpued them out, and it will not return to its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or lick them up again; no ſuch dirty dog ſhall ever trample on that golden pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is ſuch a curſed irreconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contrariety in their natures, to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed company and exerciſes in heaven, that certainly they cannot deſire, much leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in that place; If the Preſence of Chriſt were ſuch a torment to them in his eſtate of humiliation: what a torment would it be in his eſtate of exaltation! it

            <p>Secondly, a Chriſtian by death, ſhall not only be freed from the evil of ſin and defilement, but alſo from the evil of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and chaſtiſement:<note place="margin">Sublatae<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Sinne is that great-bellied mother (or rather Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) which conceiveth and bringeth forth all thoſe loſſes, croſſes, diſeaſes, diſgraces, ſorrowes and ſufferings whatſoever, that befall the children of men; though man may be the Butt, yet ſin is the mark at which the arrows of Divine diſpleaſure are ſhot; man weaves a ſpiders web of ſinne out of his own bowels, and then in intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in it. <hi>Wickedneſſe alone is the original cauſe of all we,</hi> Lament. 3.39. Rom. 6. <hi>ult.</hi> But now at the death of a Saint, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38111:57"/> of ſin will be dryed up, and therefore the ſtreams of ſufferings muſt be dryed up alſo. The fuel being taken away, the fire will go out of it ſelf: ſin and ſorrow were born, do live, and ſhall die toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>As ſin is the original cauſe of all, ſo it's the final cauſe of moſt afflictions. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are for probation (as we ſhoot at good armour, that we may prove it, and that we may praiſe it) but moſt commonly they are for purgation, to amend ſomething that is amiſs: the fathers of the fleſh cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtize for their pleaſure; but the father of ſpirits for our profit, <hi>that we might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his holineſſe, Heb.</hi> 12.6. the quiet fruits of righteouſneſſe bloſſome from the correcting rod: bitter Aloes purges the worms, winds and thunder clear the air, froſts and ſhowers whiten cloaths; the husbandman uſeth the flail to ſeparate the chaff, and the refiner the fire to conſume the droſſe; but when the wheat ſhall be clean, there will be no need of the flail, when the gold pure, no uſe of the fire: now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>if need be, ye are in heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. Mark, now if need be, now men have hard knots, and therefore need

            <p>There are three evils of affliction which I ſhall mention:
<list>
                  <item>The firſt on the Name.</item>
                  <item>The ſecond on the Body.</item>
                  <item>The third on the Soul.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>From all which a believer ſhall be freed by death.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Death will free the Saint from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy on his name: Here if the world cannot make the chriſtian wound his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they will be ſure to wound his credit: <hi>Elijah</hi> is counted the troubler of <hi>Iſrael, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah a rebel againſt the King, David the ſong of the drunkards, and the ſcorn of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38111:58"/> gluttons, Pſalme</hi> 69.12.35.16. <hi>Iſaiah and his children for ſigns and wonders, Iſa.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Jeremiah is a man of contention, Jer.</hi> 15.10. <hi>The ſon of man a wine-bibber &amp; a glutton, Paul a peſtilent fellow, and a mover of ſedition, Acts</hi> 24.10. the uprighteſt Saint is markt for an hypocrite in the worlds Kalender: If they cannot ſmite him with their hands (their arms are not long enough alwayes) they will not fail to ſmite him with their tongues: What a preciſe fool, ſay they, is ſuch a fellow! he dares not take up his cups as we do; but could we ſee his heart, it is as bad as the worſt of ours; he will do as bad or worſe, when no body ſeeth him; he will not ſwear, but he will lie, I'le warrant you: He ſpendeth his time in nothing but going to Sermons and meetings, and is as arrant a diſſembler as liveth. Such an one of the ſame Society was guilty of ſuch a ſin, and they are all alike: theſe are your profeſſours. Thus the corruption of their hearts breaks out at their lips, and they moſt wretchedly wound even Chriſt, through the ſides of the Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>But heaven will not only wipe away all tears from the chriſtians eyes, but alſo all blots off from his name. Upright <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:38111:58"/> in heaven is above the ſound of curſed <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhekah</hi>'s tongue, which was ſet on fire of hell. Now holy <hi>David</hi> is got up that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly hill, that Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> he heareth not the railings and revilings of ſinful <hi>Shimei.</hi> The moſt ſpiteful ſcorner of them all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not throw that dirt ſo high, with which he beſpatters the Saints reputation here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As death will free the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an from ignominy in his name; ſo likewiſe from infirmities in his body: Diſeaſes cauſe death, but death will cure all diſeaſes: In this life <hi>Job</hi> had his botches, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his boil, <hi>David</hi> his wounds and ſores, the poor widdow her iſſue of blood; one man wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth away with a conſumption, like a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, till all the matter is ſpent: Another la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth under a continual ach, that like the importunate widdow will give him no reſt day nor night: this man ſpends his dayes in pain, that man hath weariſome nights appointed to him: In ſome the bridle is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the fire, and they burn with a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; in others the flood-gate is taken up from the water, and they are like to be drowned with a dropſie. The patient man complaineth, my breath is corrupt, my days
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38111:59"/> are extinct, the grave is ready for me, <hi>Job</hi> 17.1. the upright man cryeth out, <hi>My wounds ſtink, and are corrupt, my loines are filled with a loathſome diſeaſe:</hi> In one, the keepers of the houſe tremble with a palſie or lameneſſe. In a ſecond, the ſound of grinders is low, through weakneſſe. In a third, thoſe that look out of the windows are darkned through blindneſſe. In a fourth, the daughters of Muſick are brought down with deafneſſe: O what an army, not only of moral, but natural adverſaries, hath eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in his own bowels, conſtantly ſet in array againſt him, marching up, ſometimes one,<note place="margin">Phyſicians tell us, that 2000 diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy mans body, whereof 200 affect the eyes.</note> ſometime another, as the Lord of hoſts giveth the word of command. So that indeed mans body is a ſpittle or an hoſpital for diſeaſes. But death will help all this; as the blind man told the lame, when they met at the ſtake; Brother, you may caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your ſtaffe, death will cure us both: the Phyſician of ſouls will by death heal all the diſeaſes of the Saints bodies; there are ſome diſeaſes which are called <hi>opprobria me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici,</hi> becauſe they cannot cure them; but none are <hi>opprobria Chriſti,</hi> he healeth all whom he undertaketh. If the higher an houſe ſtandeth on earth, it be eſteemed the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38111:59"/> healthier; ſurely then the higheſt heavens muſt be a pure air, and all health, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.4. there ſhall be no more death, nor any more pain, <hi>for the former things are paſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:</hi> So that every chriſtian that dieth in the faith, how diſeaſed ſoever he were before, ſhall then immediately (as in the Goſpel) be made every whit whole, <hi>John</hi> 7.23.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As death will free the believer from diſeaſes in his body, ſo alſo from ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in his ſoul: The chriſtian liveth upon earth, as in a valley of tears, and often min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth his drink with weeping: As he is a man, he is born to ſorrows, as the ſparks fly upward; he cometh into the world crying, and goeth out groaning; and his whole life from the womb to the tomb is in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard a living death, or a dying life. But as he is a chriſtian, he drinketh deepeſt of this cup of ſorrows; the world is a tender mother to her children, but a ſtep-mother to ſtrangers. Sometimes the afflictions of the good cauſe high-water in the Saints heart; <hi>by the rivers of Babylon he ſits down and weepeth, when he remembreth Zion, Pſal.</hi> 137.1. He cannot but ſympathize with the miſeries of his fellow-members, as being himſelf in the body: Sometimes the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38111:60"/> of the bad cloath him with mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, like <hi>Croeſsus</hi> ſon, though dumb before, yet he cryeth out when his father is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>As with a ſword they pierce his bones, when they blaſphemouſly ſay unto him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 42.10</note> 
               <hi>Where is thy God? rivers of tears run down his eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wicked forſake Gods Law, Pſal.</hi> 119.136. Sometimes his own corruptions, like ſo many daggers ſtab him to the heart, that he ſhould abuſe ſuch an Ocean of unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble love, by ſo unſuitable a heart, and ſo unanſwerable a life: <hi>He confeſſeth his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and is ſorry for his ſins, Pſal.</hi> 38.18. Sometimes divine deſertions darken and cloud all his comforts; <hi>When God hides his face, he is troubled, Pſal.</hi> 30.7. As there are no joyes like to thoſe joyes wherewith God reviveth him in the day of his favour; ſo there is no ſorrow like to thoſe ſorrows wherewith God depreſſeth him in the day of his anger. Thus his life is a circle of ſorrows, but death will be the Funeral of his ſorrows, and reſurrection of his joyes now he ſoweth in tears, but then he ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> reap in joy. The day of death is a Saints Marriage-day: <hi>Sampſons</hi> wife indeed <hi>wep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38111:60"/> ſhall at death be ſolemnly eſpouſed, and more neerly conjoyned unto Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>all tears ſhall be wiped from its eyes, there ſhall be no more ſorrow, Revel.</hi> 21.4. At that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-day Chriſt will turn all water into wine, all mourning into mirth, all ſighing into ſinging, <hi>and cauſe the bones which he hath broken to rejoyce:</hi> Now the Saints ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows are not perfect ſorrows, (<hi>non dantur purae tenebrae,</hi> to the believer) it ſhineth and ſhowreth at the ſame time: <hi>he ſorroweth not as they which have no hope;</hi> but his joy at death ſhall be perfect joy, <hi>fulneſs of joy, Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> and permanent joy: when they ſhall ſee Chriſt at death, their hearts ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, <hi>and their joy ſhall no man take from them, John</hi> 16.22. <hi>then the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return and come to Zion with ſongs, and everlaſting joy upon their heads; they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſſe, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away, Iſa.</hi> 35. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much for the privative gain of a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian by death, or his freedome from evil.</p>
            <p>There is a ſecond thing which is poſitive,<note place="margin">Ade<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:38111:61"/>
            <p>Firſt, a believer by death ſhall gain the company of perfect Chriſtians: Death wil exempt him from all commerce with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and teach him fully the meaning of that article, <hi>The communion of Saints:</hi> In the field of this world the tares and the wheat grow together; but in that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Garner they are parted aſunder. There is no treacherous <hi>Judas</hi> among the Apoſtles, no covetous <hi>Demas</hi> among the Diſciples, no <hi>Amorites</hi> to be prickes in the eyes, and thorns in the ſides of the Iſraelite, no beſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sodomite to vex righteous <hi>Lot</hi> with their unclean converſation, no flattering <hi>Doeg</hi> ſets his foot in that heavenly Sanctuary. <hi>David</hi> doth not there complain, Wo is me that I ſojourn in <hi>Meſech,</hi> that I dwell in the tents of <hi>Kedar, My ſoul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace, Pſal.</hi> 120.4, 5. nor <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that he dwelleth among a people of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean lips, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5. nor <hi>Elijah,</hi> that he is left alone. Hell holdeth none but ſinners, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath onely Saints; He that dieth in the Lord, goeth to the congregation of the firſt-born, to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. And queſtionleſſe the ſweet company will be part of our felicity. If <hi>Platinus</hi> the Philoſopher could ſay, Let

               </note> O what a brave day will that be, when I ſhall go to the councel and company of happy ſouls, to my <hi>Cato,</hi> and other Roman Worthies! How much better will it be with the Chriſtian! when he wall ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdom of heaven, when he ſhall leave the rout and rabble of wicked ones, and be admitted into the ſociety of all that died in the faith, and be joyfully wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed by the melodious quire of Angels, and be heartily embraced by the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, yea all the Saints! Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if ever thar Proverb were true, it is here, <hi>The more the merrier:</hi> The fair ſtreams there will never be drawn dry, though it be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into many channels: the muſick there is not the leſſe harmonious, becauſe many hear it; nor the light of the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs the leſſe pleaſant, becauſe many ſee it; and O what a gain will this be, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the company of them that are holy? If <hi>Aaron</hi> when he met <hi>Moſes</hi> on earth was glad at his heart, certainly there was greater joy at their meeting in heaven. If <hi>David</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all his delight in the Saints here below,

If it were ſo lovely a ſight to ſee <hi>Solomon</hi> in his rags of mortality, that the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> came ſo far to behold it, what will it be to ſee him in his robes of glory!</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is included in this Head! The preſence of Chriſt on earth can make a mean cottage a moſt delightful court; to the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren it turned the fiery furnace into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable palace; what will it do then in Heaven. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, he had rather be

               </note> than in heaven without Chriſt. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, he had rather be in hell with Chriſt, than in heaven without Chriſt; communion with Chriſt can ſweeten the bittereſt condition. Chriſt alone is the ſalt which ſeaſons all the Saints comforts, without which nothing is ſavoury to the ſpiritual taſte. A duty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, is like a body without a ſoul, which hath neither lovelineſs nor life in it. Communion with Chriſt is one great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which inciteth the Saint to, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth him in the Ordinances of God: He attendeth on Scriptures becauſe they are they that teſtifie of Chriſt; the pearl of price is hid in that field:<note place="margin">Cant. 5.1.</note> In them the lips of Chriſt, like lillies, drop ſweet-ſmelling myrrhe; and O how his heart burneth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, with love to Chriſt, whilſt Chriſt is opening to him the Scriptures! He fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenteth prayer, becauſe therein Chriſt and his ſoul converſe together; in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he enjoyeth much of Ch iſts quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning preſence; he ſpeaketh to Chriſt by holy ſupplications, and Chriſt to him by heavenly conſolations: He mindeth faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe therein his ſoul may with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt have a ſpiritual feaſt; or the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38111:63"/> greateſt cauſe of his weeping is with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him:</hi> The means of grace are therefore ſo deſirable and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe rhey are the Galleries wherein he walketh, talketh, feedeth, and feaſteth with the Lord of glory.</p>
            <p>The higheſt duty without Chriſt is as a diſh without meat, from which he goeth as empty and unſatisfied as he came to it; It is to him as <hi>Tullies Hortenſ.</hi> to <hi>Auſtine,</hi> of little worth, if the Name of Jeſus be not there.</p>
            <p>If he love the Saints with a love of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, 'tis becauſe they are Chriſts ſeed; if he love the ſinner with a love of pity, 'tis for Chriſts ſake; his affections are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or enlarged towards any thing, as it hath leſſe or more relation to Chriſt; and nothing is of true value or worth in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, which hath not <hi>aliquid Chriſti,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſt in it.</p>
            <p>Now conſider <hi>Reader,</hi> if the preſence of Chriſt be ſo precious, ſo pleaſant to the Chriſtian here, when he can ſee ſo little of his excellent beauty, and receive ſo little of his infinite bounty; what will it be when he ſhall appear to the ſoul in all his royalty,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38111:63"/> and fill the water-pots of the ſoul up to the brim, with the riches of grace and glory!</p>

               <hi>Demorrhathus</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> ſaith, they loſt the chief part of their lives happineſſe, that did not ſee <hi>Alexander</hi> ſit on the throne of <hi>Darius;</hi> if that were ſuch an happy ſight, what a ſight ſhall the Saints have to ſee Chriſt on his Fathers Throne?

He that hath Chriſt with him by grace, may ſay with <hi>Peter, Maſter, it is good to be here;</hi> but he that is with Chriſt in glory, may ſay with <hi>Paul, To be with Chriſt is far better,</hi> without doubt beſt of all. They were bleſſed which ſaw him in his eſtate of debaſement, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.23. but much more bleſſed will they be, that ſhall ſee him in his eſtate of advancement.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Saint by death ſhall gain the full and immediate fruition of God. The former were excellent; but this as the Sun among the Planets ſurpaſſeth them all: The other were as Rivers, this is the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean; they were as branches bearing good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruit, but this is the root upon which they grow: they all as lines meet in this center: this is the top-ſtone of the celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al building; this is the higheſt ſtair, the apex of the Saints happineſſe. This is the greateſt gift which the creature can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ask, or the infinite God beſtow. The boundleſſe God cannot well give a greater mercy than this. Is any thing, yea are all things in heaven and earth equal to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38111:64"/> God? God alone is the higheſt object of faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. and therefore the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ground of joy and ſatisfaction to the ſoul, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17. <hi>ult.</hi> The Viſion of God is the beatifical viſion, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fruition of God will cauſe perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſoul. The enjoyment of God is the great deſire and delight of the Saints on earth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42.1, 2. nay it is the happineſſe of the humane nature of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16.5, 6. without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion then it will be the Heaven of Heaven.

            <p>The preſence of this King will make the Court indeed.

            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:38111:65"/>
            <p>This is the gain of a Saint by death, he ſhall gain the fruition of God.

No, it is God alone that is the centre to which the Saint moveth, and in which he reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>O what happineſſe ſhall the holy man have at death, to be ever with God!

It is reported of <hi>Eudoxius,</hi> that he was ſo extream deſirous to be near the Sun, that he might ſee it, and know its nature, that he profeſt, ſo he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his deſire, though but for one hour, he would willingly be burn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38111:66"/> and what gainers are they by death, that come thereby <hi>to ſee him as he is, and to know him as they are known of him?</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. 1 Cor. 13.12.</p>
            <p>But the Chriſtian ſhall not barely enjoy God after death, for that he doth in this life, but he ſhall enjoy God fully. Now the Saint enjoyeth a little of God, and O how refreſhing is it to his weary ſoul! but then he ſhall have as much of God, as his heart can wiſh or hold. In this life there is a Communication of God, anſwerable to the capacities of men, and the fault is in us, not in God that we receive no more of him on earth. The ground is not in the Sun, but in the narrowneſſe of our windowes, that we partake no more of its light; the cauſe is in the ſmallneſſe of our veſſels, not in the well, that we carry away no more of its water. If our mouths were never ſo wide-opened, God would fill them now: But then the windowes of the ſoul ſhall be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and the veſſels of the heart enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo fitted for, and filled with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter participation of God. There is not the leaſt complaint of want; All the Patriarchs ſacks are there filled with corn; There <hi>Davids</hi> cup runneth over; there the holy
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38111:67"/> 
               <hi>Epheſians</hi> are filled with all the fulneſſe of God. <hi>In that Fathers houſe there is bread e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and to ſpare for all his children. There is given to all good meaſure, preſsed down, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken together, and running over,</hi> Luk. 6.38.</p>
            <p>We ſay there is no fiſhing like to the Sea, becauſe the Sea hath the greateſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the vaſteſt capacity; there are fiſh enough to fill all our nets, and lade all our ſhips. I may more truly ſay, there is no fruition like to the fruition of God; he hath enough, not only to ſupply all our indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, and to ſatisfie all our neceſſities, and deſires, but he can do abundantly for us, above what we are able to ask or think, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.20.

            <p>Now a Chriſtian is deſcribed by his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirſting, his panting and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing after a perfect conformity to God, that thereby he may be prepared for perfect Communion with God; but bleſſed are they which now thus hunger and thirſt, for then they ſhall be filled, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6.

            <p>Apoſtles, Prophets, Paſtours, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11.12, 13. When God ſhall be all in all, then (and not till then) Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances will be nothing at all. When the Saint comes to his journeys end, he may throw away his ſtaffe. Now how much will this adde to the former, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhall without ordinances enjoy God!
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38111:69"/> 
               <hi>How lovely is the face of God, though it be but in the glaſse of the Goſpel?</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. this was the one thing which <hi>David</hi> begg'd, <hi>that he might dwell in the houſe of the Lord, to ſee the beauty of his face, Pſal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Ah how lovely will he be, when the Chriſtian ſhall ſee him face to face!</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo good to draw neer to God on earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>ult.</hi> and if they are bleſſed <hi>that watch at Wiſdomes gates, and wait at the poſts of her doors, Prov.</hi> 8.34. how good will it be to draw neer to God in heaven; and how bleſſed are they that (wait not at the door, but) dwell in that houſe!</p>
            <p>How pleaſant will it be for the ſoul, when it's eyes ſhall be ſtrengthened to ſee God as he is, without the ſpectacles of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. We eſteem that honey ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt which is ſuckt immediately out of the comb (though hony out of a diſh is ſweet) and we do with more delight eat that fruit which we gather ourſelvs from the tree, than we do that which is brought to us through others hands: The enjoyment of God is ſo ſweet in the diſh of a Duty, that a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an would ſooner loſe the beſt friend he hath than it: But O how ſweet will it be in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38111:69"/> comb of immediate communion! This fruit is very delightful and pleaſant, as it is conveyed through the hands of Miniſters (though the liquor will ſente of the cask) but O with what delight (Chriſtian, canſt thou read it, and thy heart not warmed with joy?) with what pleaſure wilt thou with thine own hands gather this fruit from the Tree of life, that ſtandeth in the midſt of Paradiſe? <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given thee a little of that great gain which a Saint hath by death; death will free him ftom all evil, both of ſin and ſuffering; it will give him the fruition of ali good, in the enjoyment of perfect Saints, and the bleſſed Saviour, and in full immediate communion with the infinite God, who is bleſſed, and bleſſing his for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: This is the heritage of a righteous man from God, and this is the portion of his cup: thus ſhall it be done to the man, whom the King of heaven delights to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. There is but one thing more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make the Chriſtian perfectly happy; and that is the eternity of all this: but I ſhall ſpeak to that in the laſt uſe. I now proceed to the application of the Point.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:38111:70"/>
            <p>The firſt uſe which I ſhall make of this Doctrine, ſhall be by way of information: If ſuch as have Chriſt for their life, ſhall have gain by their death; it informeth us of the difference betwixt the deaths of the ſinner and the Saint: the one is an unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable gainer; the other an unconceivable loſer by death. Death to the good is the gate through which they go into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven: death to the bad is the trap-door through which they fall into hell. The godly dyeth as well as the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the wicked man dieth not ſo well as the godly. The metal and the droſſe go both into the fire; but the metal is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and the droſſe conſumed: As the cloud in the wilderneſſe had a light ſide to the <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> but a dark ſide to the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> ſo death hath nothing but light and comfort for the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God; nothing but darkneſſe and ſorrow for the ſinful <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Death to every one is a meſſenger ſent from the Lord of life; it cometh to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, as the young Prophet to <hi>Jehu;</hi> I have an errand to thee, O Captain; and what was his errand? he poured the oil on his head, ſaying, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I have anointed thee King over Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:38111:70"/> 9.5, 6. It is a meſſenger from God to call the Chriſtian to a Kingdome which cannot be ſhaken. But it commeth to the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, as <hi>Ehud</hi> to <hi>Eglon: And Ehud ſaid, I have a meſsage from God unto thee;</hi> and what was his meſſage? <hi>Judges</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thruſt it into Eglons belly:</hi> It is a meſſenger from God, with a mortal wounding, killing, ſtabbing meſſage to a ſinner. The pale white horſe of death rides before, and the red fiery horſe of hell follows after.</p>
            <p>The people of God paſs ſafely through this red Sea of death, which his enemies aſſaying to do, are drowned, are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>There is a great diſ-agreement in the lives of the holy and unholy; but O what a vaſt difference is there in their deaths! they are like two parallel lines; how far ſoever they go together, they never touch in a point. Their wayes differ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ends muſt neceſſarily differ: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans end is virtually in his way; their ways differ as much as light and darkneſſe, and therefore their ends muſt differ as far as heaven and hell.

            <p>The blind world indeed, as it ſeeth not their difference in life, (the life of a Saint is an hidden life, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. the <hi>Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is all glorious, but 'tis within, Pſal.</hi> 45.13. the jewels of her graces are laid up in that privy Drawer, <hi>the hidden man of the heart:</hi>) ſo it beholdeth not the difference in their deaths: As dieth the wiſe man, ſo dieth the fool, to the eye of ſenſe, and they want the <hi>eye of faith, Eccleſ.</hi> 2.16.

            <p>Men, ſaith a modern writer, like ſilly fiſhes, ſee one another caught, and jerkt out of the pond of life; but they ſee not (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las) the fire and pan into which they are caſt, who die in their ſins; Oh it had been better ſurely for ſuch, if they had never been born, as Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Judas, then to be brought forth</hi> to the murtherer (that old man-ſlayer) to be hurled into hell, there to ſuffer ſuch things as they ſhall never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to avoid, or abide.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, thou ſtandeſt by a ſcorned perſecuted Saint, when he is bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding adieu to a ſinful world; thou ſeeſt the ſtruglings and droopings of his outward man, but thou ſeeſt not the reviving cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial the Phyſician of ſouls is preparing for his inward man; thou doeſt not ſee thoſe glorious Angels which watch and wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this heaven-born ſoul.</p>

If like a dog thou ſnatcheſt at the childrens bread, thou art more bold than wel-come, and wilt one day be well beaten for thy preſumption. Reader, if thou art unregenerate and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, look to thy ſelf, for thy lot muſt fall on this ſide the promiſed Land. Thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt like a Surveyour of Land, take a view of anothers Mannor, and bring a return, how ſtately the houſe is, how pleaſant the gardens, how delightful the walks, how fruitful the Paſtures, how finely it's ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how fully it's woodded, how ſweetly it is watered, how fitly it is every way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated: but as long as the Pronoun is wanting, it can be but little comfort, it is none of thine. So thou mayſt read, and hear much of that comfort, joy and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that incomparable Kingdome, which the holy ſhall immediately upon their deaths enter into; but what is all this to thee, when thou muſt be without it for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? thou mayſt ſee <hi>Abram</hi> afar off, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his boſome, but between him and thee, there will be a great gulf.</p>

            <p>As a ſtranger thou mayſt hear the laſt Will and Teſtament of Chriſt read, and therein the fair, rich and large portions, which he hath bequeathed to his children, <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. but not the leaſt mention made of any good for thee; look from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to the end of <hi>Revelation,</hi> and ſee if there be one good word ſpoken to thee, whil'ſt thou art in thy natural eſtate. <hi>Moſes</hi> like, thou mayſt by the proſpective of Scripture, have a <hi>Piſgah</hi> ſight of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> of that good Land flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with milk and hony; but as God is true, if thou dieſt in unregeneracy, thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoy one foot of it.</p>
            <p>The worſt of a Saint is paſt when he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; but thy worſt O ſinner is to come; there are ſome dregs in the bottome which thou art yet to drink down, thou haſt thy good things here, and he his evil things; but at death he is comforted, and thou art tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. He hath all his hell upon earth, his heaven is to come; thou haſt all thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on earth, and thy hell is to come when thou paſſeſt into another world; the hell of a Saint is an eaſie hell.

            <p>But it may be, Friend, thou art one that thriveſt in this world, and therefore doſt not trouble thy head, much leſſe thy heart, with the things of another world; thou art unwilling to put a ſpoonful of thoſe thoughts into thy ſauce, leaſt it ſhould make thy meat unſavory, it would mar thy mirth, and ſpoile thy ſports. As <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperor, did not love the pronunciation of the Greek Zeta, becauſe it repreſented the gnaſhing teeth of a dying man; ſo thou art reſolved to baniſh ſuch enemies (as thou thinkeſt) out of thy coaſts, and like a bear, to go down that ſteep hill of death back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But know thou, O man, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt conſider of thy death before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand or no, it is haſtening upon thee; though thou putteſt it farre from thee, whether thou wilt or no it draweth nigh to thee; the ſhip moveth not ſo faſt in the waters, nor the Sun in the heavens, as thou art haſtening towards thy long, thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting home, and then death will bring thee up a reckoning for all thy ſweet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, merry meetings, time and talents whatſoever; believe it then, thou wilt have

The higher thou aſcendeſt on this ladder, the greater thy fall, when death turneth thee off; thou art but ripening for ruine, and fatting on earth to fry in hell, all the while thou art flouriſhing in a courſe of ſinning; nay, thou mayeſt be much nearer hell, then thou art aware of; The mettal when it ſhineth brighteſt in the fire, is neareſt melting; thou like a candle, mayſt give a blaze when thou art going out of the world, into blackneſſe of darkneſſe for ever. The Hawk flieth high, and is as highly prized being ſet upon a Pearch, and ſet out with the gingling bells of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and carried on his Maſters fiſt, but being once dead, and pitched over the Pearch, is caſt upon the dunghill as good for nothing; The Hen ſcrapes in the duſt, nothing rewarded while ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,

            <p>But that I may awaken thy conſcience, O ſecure ſinner, and make thee look about thee, whil'ſt there is time and hope (if the gracious and powerful God pleaſe to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt) I ſhall give thee an eſtimate of the ſinners loſſes by death, by which thou mayeſt ſee what a difference there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the death of the titular, and the real Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>And here Reader thou muſt help me with thy conceptions, for I ſhall come infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhort in my expreſſions.

            <p>Death is the great thief which will rob

It is now no mean mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to thee, hadſt thou an heart to prize and improve it, that thou enjoyeſt the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, the means of grace, many golden ſeaſons, for the good of thy ſoul, that thou mayſt ſit at Gods feet, and hear his voice out of Scripture, fall down on thy knees, and ſeek his face by prayer; but know to thy ſorrow, death wil rob thee of all theſe Jewels; Now thou haſt the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of mercy, the intreaties of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the motions of the Spirit, the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt, liberty to caſt thy ſelf down at the foot-ſtool of Heavens Majeſty, and to be as fervent and inſtant as thou wilt, for mercy, but then the gate wil be ſhut, and there wil be no praying, or hearing, or preaching in the place whether thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.11 <hi>Shall thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse be declared in the grave? or thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſse in deſtruction?</hi> the interrogation is a ſtrong negation. There is no preaching of Gods clemency or fidelity, either in the grave or hel. All the Lectures read in the former, are by worms of mans mortality; and all the Sermons heard in the latter, are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:38111:80"/> of mans miſery, and Gods ſeverity. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I aſſure thee from the living God, that though in this life thou art now and then bungling about a duty, and giving God thy ſtinking breath, a few cold lazy petitions, which proceed from thy corrupt lungs, thy curſed heart, thou ſhalt do ſo no more after death. As the Saints ſhall be above this mediate enjoyment of God, ſo thou ſhalt be below it. And truly, hadſt thou ever had Communion with God in a duty, this loſſe would go near thee; <hi>How amiable is the worſhipping of God to a gracious ſoul? he prizeth Ordinances, becauſe they are the means of it in this world, above his eſtate, and food, or what ever is deare to him,</hi> Pſa. 119.14, 72, 111. Job 23.12. Pſa. 84.1.2, 3. And this priviledge he ſhall have by death, to be employed ſtil about the ſame work, (of pleaſing, glorifying, worſhipping, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying God) only he ſhall do it in a more excellent and more delightful way.</p>
            <p>He continueth as it were in the ſame School; death only removes him to an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er form, or (if you will) death ſends him from the School (in which he was fitted and prepared) to the Univerſity of heaven; but O ſinner, thou muſt be deprived of this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:38111:80"/> happineſſe; indeed now thou eſteemeſt the Ordinances of God a burden; as precious as they are to others, they are tedious to thee. <hi>The Church is thy Goal, the Sabbath is thy ague-day, the commands of Chriſt are bonds and fetters to thee,</hi> Pſa. 72.3. The voice of thy carnal heart is, when wil the glaſſe be out? when wil the duty be done? when wil the Sabbath be over? that thou mayſt follow the world, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. Thou thinkeſt the prayer is too long, the Sermon is too long, the Sabbath is too long, the duties are all too long; wel, be patient but a little, a ſhort time, and thou ſhalt never be troubled with theſe long duties more; <hi>The night is coming, when there is no working,</hi> Joh. 9.4. <hi>There is no enjoying Sabbath or Sacraments, or ſeaſons of grace, no wiſdome, knowledge or device, in the grave to which thou art haſtening, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10.</p>
            <p>Now the Miniſter exhorteth thee to caſt away thy ſins, and come to thy Saviour, to reject thy ſoul-damning luſts, and accept of a ſoul-ſaving Lord; The Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth thee by his Soveraignty over thee, and propriety in thee as thy Creatour; The Son entreateth thee, by preſenting his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſweat and ſufferings unto thee, as he is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:38111:81"/> thy Redeemer; The Spirit ſtirreth thee to pity thy precious ſoul, and to minde thine unchangeable eſtate, to conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in this day of Gods patience, the things which concern thy eternal peace; The Goſpel is a Treaſure of ineſtimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, freely offered to thee, upon condition thou wilt but heartily embrace it and the eaſie yoke of Chriſt together; The Word of God chargeth, inviteth, allureth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheth, promiſeth, threateneth; all theſe like ſo many Trumpets, do loudly ſound a retreat, to call thee off from thy ſlavery to the world and fleſh, unto the glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Sons of God: but thou art as deaf as the Adder, and wilt not hear the voice of theſe heavenly charmes; as hard as the Rock; the waves of threatenings which daſh unweariedly againſt thee, ſtirre thee not; the ſhowres and dews of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which fall on thee continually, make no impreſſion, neither mercies nor judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, neither men nor God can prevaile with thee; Well ſinner, think of it again and again (and thy heart is hardened with a witneſſe, if it do not tremble to think of it) the hour is approaching, when thou ſhalt never have theſe tenders, theſe invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:38111:81"/> theſe means, theſe motions more, though thou ſhalt earneſtly, and unceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire them, and willingly accept of them if they could be granted thee; after thou haſt fryed as many millions of yeares in hell, as there are ſtars in the heavens, piles of graſſe on the earth, and ſands on the ſea ſhoar; yet thy intreaty upon ſuch an hard condition ſhall be denied, then thou wilt befool thy ſelf to purpoſe, for ſtaying til the day after the faire, for not accepting when thou waſt wel offered; then mercy wil be mercy indeed, then grace wil be grace indeed, then the Goſpel wil be glad-ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings indeed, when by the want of them thou ſhalt fully know the worth of them.</p>
            <p>Now God holdeth the Candle of his Word to thee, and inſtead of working, thou playeſt; inſtead of working out thy own ſalvation, inſtead of working the works of him that ſent thee into the world, thou playeſt the fool, the drunkard, the beaſt, the hypocrite, the Atheiſt; wel, thou ſhalt go into utter darkneſſe, where thoſe lights which thou now enjoyeſt, will never ſhine.</p>

It is a bleſſing to thee upon earth, (did the Lord but ſanctifie it to thee) that thy lot is caſt in a Land, in a Pariſh, in a family, where thoſe holy ones are, that thou mayſt hear their gracious prayers, ſee their pious patterns, and enjoy their preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous precepts.<note place="margin">Homo boni pedis.</note> A Saint is as the Proverb is in <hi>Africa,</hi> A man whoſe coming is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous; this churliſh <hi>Laban</hi> could confeſſe,

Thy dead hope (for Saints only have <hi>a lively hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.) wil fail thee at death. As thou haſt no true holineſs, ſo thou canſt have no true hope; but ſomething 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou haſt, upon which thou relieſt as to thy future eſtate. It may be, thou haſt the good things of this life, and thence conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thy right to a better life; as if becauſe the great Houſe-keeper of the world throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſome bones to the dogs, therefore he muſt love them with a paternal love; thou do'ſt not conſider, their houſes may be full of gold, whoſe hearts are empty of grace, and whoſe ſouls ſhall aſſuredly come ſhort of glory, <hi>Job</hi> 22.17, 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.13, 14.</p>
            <p>It may be it is thy profeſſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that holds thee up by the chin, and keepeth from ſinking; as if becauſe a ſtage-player is dreſt in the Robes, and for a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an houre acteth the part of a King, he muſt therefore have a real right to the Dignity, Dominions, and Revenues of the Regal Office, not believing that thoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours

Or it is likely, thou enjoyeſt the priviledges of the Goſpel; Sabbaths, Sacraments, and the ſeaſons of grace are the bladders, with the help of which (without an inward change) thou thinkeſt to ſwim to heaven; do'ſt thou not know that many go to hel fire with Font-water on their faces, and from the table, to the tormentour? <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.13. that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> a caſt-away, and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> an out-caſt, had both <hi>Abram</hi> to their father; and ſo had they whom truth it ſelf aſſureth, <hi>that they were of their father the divel,</hi> John 8.44. <hi>Circumciſion availeth nothing, nor uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, but a new creature, Gal.</hi> 6.15. All ſuch things are but <hi>lying words,</hi> where an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal work of grace is wanting, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Or poſſibly thou art a man of many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; thou mindeſt ſecret, family, relation-duties, (which too too many neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) praying, reading, hearing, Chriſtian communion; like the ſpider thou weaveſt a curious web out of thine own bowels, and therewith makeſt thee a houſe in which thou reſteſt quietly; but O friend, God

This, and all the reſt as nigh as they ſeem to be to heaven, will prove but a Caſtle in the air; whether any or all theſe, or ſomething elſe be the Pillars by which thy hope is upheld in life, they wil fail thee at death; and then the rotten props being taken away, the houſe of thy hope wil fall. Theſe are all but a ſandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore when that great ſtorm comes, <hi>they will down to the ground, Matth.</hi> 7.26, 27.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible thou mayeſt hope all the time thou liveſt, but thy life and hope wil depart together; like thy neighbours, thou mayſt be ful of hope even when thou art going into the pit of deſpaire; and die in peace, though thou art going unto the place of eternal war; but the next moment after death, thy hopes wil take wings and flie away. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.7. <hi>When a wicked man dieth, his expectation ſhall periſh, and the hope of unjuſt men periſheth.</hi> He died perhaps with his head ful of hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, as thoſe ſeemed to have done, that came bouncing at heavens gate, <hi>with Lord, Lord open to us;</hi> but ſoon were their hearts filled with deſperation, when they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:38111:85"/> heard, <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I know you not. Etiam ſpes valentiſſima periit,</hi> as ſome read that fore-cited place, <hi>His great hope ſhall be little worth.</hi> A falſe heart and falſe hope can never hold out in ſuch a real hardſhip. <hi>Job</hi> 27.8. <hi>What is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained, when God ſhall take away his ſoul.</hi> An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor gloſſeth on it thus; The anchor of a wicked mans hope entereth not within the vail (as a godly mans doth cloſing with God himſelf in Chriſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.19. which anchor in all ſtorms is <hi>ſure and ſtedfaſt</hi>) but is caſt upon falſe and looſe ground, and therefore when the ſtorm comes, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor drives and is unſtedfaſt; and ſo his hope and heart fail together. The ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt unregenerate man alive wil drop at laſt; when God cometh to take away his ſoul, then his creſt falls, and his plumes flagge. <hi>The wicked is driven away in his wickedneſse, Prov.</hi> 14.32.</p>
            <p>He being arreſted by death as a cruel ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, in the divels name is hurried away, and hurld into hel; as <hi>Syrens</hi> are ſaid to ſing curiouſly while they live, but to roare hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly when they die; ſo thou that art high in hope on earth, wilt be lower in grief in

Believe it, thy life will be an heaven upon earth. And ſhouldſt thou find thy eſtate loſt, will it not be an infinite mercy to thee, that thou didſt know it before it was too late! how will it awaken thee out of thy ſecurity, and affrighten thee upon the apprehenſion of thy miſery! how will it quicken thee to mind thy duty! in loathing thy ſelf, in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thy ſins, and in flying to thy Saviour.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Ask thy ſoul what is the principle of thy Religious performances, what is the ſpring of thy obedience; men indeed judge of others principles by their practices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot diſcern the heart, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be right in a duty or no; but God judgeth of mens practices by their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as we may ſee by his ſpeech of <hi>Paul, Behold he prayeth, Act.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> one of the ſtricteſt of them, and they were much in prayer, but God who knew his heart was wrong in former duties, takes not any notice of them; now <hi>behold he prayeth;</hi> he might ſay a prayer before, but he never pray'd a prayer til now; when he had a right principle, being regenerated by the holy Ghoſt, then and not till then he made a right prayer. Til the Tree be good, the fruit can never be good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.17. Now Friend, what is the principle of thy duties? is it fear of men, hope of honour, deſire of gain, or mearly the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:38111:115"/> the mouth of conſcience, or cuſtome? are theſe the weights that make thy Clock to go? and if theſe were taken off, would thy devotion ſtand ſtill? then thy heart is not right in the ſight of God; intreat him for the Lords ſake, that the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee; Or do thy pious actions flow from a renewed will, and renewed affections? Doth the outward correſpondency of thy life to the Law of God, proceed from an inward conformity in thy heart to the nature and Law of God, from the Law written within? if it be thus, thy condition is ſafe; for the deeper the ſpring is from whence the water comes, the ſweeter the water is, and thy ſervices the more acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>Speak thy ſelf, whether thou prayeſt, readeſt, heareſt, ſingeſt from the Divine nature within, from love to the infinitely amiable God, from the delight thou takeſt in communion with him in duties; O how ſweet is that hony, that drops of its own accord from the comb! and how pure is that Wine which floweth freely from the grape! So grateful and acceptable is that ſacrifice to God, which is ſeaſon'd with ſincere love. <hi>Bleſsed is the man that feareth
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:38111:116"/> the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Pſal.</hi> 128.1.</p>
            <p>Or doſt thou worſhip God from the ſame principle the <hi>Sadduces</hi> do, who deny the Reſurrection? only from a deſire it may go well with thee in this life; or from the ſame principle from which the <hi>Perſians</hi> do the divel? only from fear leaſt he ſhould do thee hurt; ſurely that ſervice will be ſowr, which like verjuice is ſqueezed out of the crabs; To ſerve God with a filial fear is commendable, but to ſerve him from a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile fear is unacceptable.</p>
            <p>The upright Chriſtian worketh from an inward principle, the new Creation within; and thence it is, that ſpiritual things are ſo natural and delightful to his regenerate part, as we ſee in <hi>David, I delight to do thy will, O my God;</hi> how cometh this to paſſe, but from an inward principle? <hi>Thy Law is within my heart, Pſal.</hi> 40.8. or as it is in <hi>Hebrew, Thy Law is in the midſt of my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.</hi> But now an hypocrite uſually acteth from ſome outward principle, as the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.14, 27. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.1, 5. the wind from without makes their Mill to go; ſome goads, or whips, force them forward; hence it is, that like tired Jades,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:38111:116"/> they are preſently weary, and deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then to reſt, and ceaſe from ſuch unpleaſant labour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Ask thy ſoul what is the pattern of thy life; whom doſt thou labour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, is it Chriſt or thy Neighbour? Do'ſt thou ſet thy watch by the Town Clock, or by the dial of Scripture, becauſe that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver faileth of going according to the Sun of Righteouſneſſe? A man dead ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (like dead fiſh) ever ſwimmeth down with the ſtream of the times, will follow a multitude to do evil, cannot endure to be ſingular; like the Planet <hi>Mercury</hi> (at beſt) if in conjunction with good, he is good; if with bad, he is bad; or like water, taketh the figure of the veſſel, what ever it be, into which it is put; But now a living Chriſtian doth not dreſſe himſelf by the glaſſe of the times; whil'ſt he is in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of this world, he may follow the cloud of faithful Witneſſes, but it muſt be no farther then they follow Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. Chriſt is the great ſtandard by which he meaſureth and trieth, and which he endeavoureth to imitate in his thoughts, words &amp; actions; He doth <hi>uti verbis &amp; nummis praeſentibus, &amp; vivere moribus praeteritis,</hi> uſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:38111:117"/> ſuch words and money as is currant at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but lives after that example which was in times paſt; the patterns of godly men bear much ſway with him; but he knoweth there are ſome things in their lives,<note place="margin">Admonet non omnes promiſcue eſſe imitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos. <hi>Calv. in Phil. 3.</hi>

The holy Ghoſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Spirit of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. and indeed he only hath this ſpiritual life, that hath this Spirit of life; As all the members of the natural body are actuated and enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame humane ſpirit from the Head; So all the Members of the Myſtical body are quickened and actuated by the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:38111:121"/> ſame Divine Spirit from their Head the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Mark therefore that one place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. how full it is to this purpoſe; for upon that place, the weight of all I have to ſpeak further about this Uſe of trial will depend. The words are theſe, <hi>But ye are not in the fleſh, but in the Spirit, if ſo be the Spirit of God dwell in you.</hi> (Mark) <hi>Now if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> Obſerve I beſeech thee, If any man, let him pretend never ſo much, let his priviledges be never ſo many, let his profeſſion be never ſo great, and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances never ſo numerous, <hi>yet if he have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his;</hi> ſo that if the Spirit of Chriſt have not its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in thee, thou haſt no ſpiritual relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall teach thee to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Spirit be in thee or no, by two of its effects or properties; the firſt will be more general, the ſecond more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Spirit of God if it be in thee, will purifie thee, for it is a purifying Spirit. Sanctification is the proper work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt. It is called the holy Ghoſt; and it is holy not only ſubjectively, but ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:38111:121"/> 
               <hi>it worketh holineſſe, and makes men holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. It infuſeth holy habits and principles into the ſoul, whereby it is enabled to fight with, and by degrees to foyl its corruptions; It changeth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by illumination, the will by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, and the affections by ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it doth not infuſe new faculties into the ſoul, but it doth renew the old; it turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame waters into another Channel; they ran before after the world and the fleſh, but now after God and his wayes; It is as it were the ſame viol, only it is new tuned; before it could make no muſick in praying or ſinging, but now it is ſo melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, that it delighteth the heart, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſheth the ear of God himſelf. The old Moon and the new are the ſame, only the new hath a new endowment of light from the Sun, which it had not before; ſo it is here, the purified perſon is the ſame man he was before, only he hath a new endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the light of holineſſe, which he had not before. Now thus the Spirit ever work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where it dwelleth; it is therefore called <hi>a river of living waters, John</hi> 7.37. not a pond of dead, but a river of living waters; a pond will ſuffer dirt and mud to continue
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:38111:122"/> in it without oppoſition; but a river of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters purgeth out, and caſteth up its mire and dirt, its foam and ſcum, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20. So the ſpirit of the world and fleſh will let Atheiſm, pride, and unbelief to lodge and lurk in the ſoul without reſiſtance, unleſſe it be a little from a natural conſcience; but the Spirit of God worketh out theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, as generous wine worketh out lees and dregs. The Spirit is alſo called <hi>fire, Acts</hi> 2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. for as fire fighteth with the cold water that is over it, and by degrees conquereth it, and reduceth the water to its own likeneſſe of heat in ſome meaſure; ſo the Spirit luſteth and fighteth againſt the fleſh, and by degrees overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the intereſt of it, captivateth the ſoul to the obedience of Chriſt, and conformeth the whole man in ſome meaſure to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God.</p>
            <p>Examine thy ſoul by this; Doth the ſpirit within thee combat with, and conquer thy corruptions? Doth it enable thee to caſt them away with ſhame and deteſtation? Hath it turned the bent of thy heart, and ſtream of thy affections, after ſpiritual and heavenly things? The waters of the ſea (as ſome write) though by their naturall
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:38111:122"/> courſe they follow the center; yet in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Moon are ſubject to her moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo turn and return, ebbe and flow. So though thou by nature didſt follow the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eye, and the pride of life, yet in obedience to the Spirit doſt thou now follow its motions? Hath the intereſt of the Spirit an actual predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy in thy ſoul, above the intereſt of the fleſh? Canſt thou ſay, that the intereſt of the ſpirit, and the intereſt of the fleſh, do often meet together, on a narrow bridge, where both cannot go forward together, and uſually thou ſuffereſt the Spirit to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the fleſh to go back? When two Maſters walk together, and a ſervant follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after, it is not eaſie to know to which of the two the ſervant belongs, but when the Maſters part, the ſervant is diſcovered whoſe he is; When relgiion and the world have their intereſts together, thou mayſt be hid; but when thy credit and Chriſt, thy pleaſure and the ſpirit come in competition (as they will very often) thou mayſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy ſelf clearly, whore ſervant thou art. Speak friend, and let thy conſcience witneſs, whether it be thus or no; thou maſt deceive and thereby undo thy ſelf, but thou canſt not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:38111:123"/> deceive God; for if the Spirit do not ſanctifie thee, the Son will never ſave thee. <hi>Pharao</hi>'s Court admitted of Frogs and Lice, and <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark received unclean Beaſts into it; but no ſuch vermine can crawle into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Court: Into it can in no wiſe enter (obſerve Reader) in no wiſe any thing that is defiled or unclean, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.17. Theſe are the words of the true and living God. Canſt thou think that thou haſt the Spirit of God, and ſhalt be a gainer by death, who art a ſervant of unrighteouſneſs, who haſt vain-glory, covetouſneſs, hypocriſie, carnal-mindedneſs within thee, and never mourneſt under them, as one heavy laden with them, nor longeſt after,<note place="margin">Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam coram deo juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem individuo nexu comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur, nec ab ea ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari poteſt, etiamſi diſtingui debeat. <hi>Polan.

            <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God is a praying Spirit:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:38111:123"/> it is called <hi>the ſpirit of grace and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>the ſpirit of adoption,</hi> Rom. 8.15. <hi>and of his Son, whereby they that have it cry</hi> Abba <hi>Father, Gal.</hi> 4.6.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt in Heaven makes interceſſion for them without them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. ſo the Spirit of Chriſt on earth maketh interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them within them; God never had any ſtill-born children. The fathers after the fleſh ſometimes have dumbe children, but the Father of ſpirits never had any ſuch. Mans invocation of God preſently follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon Gods effectual vocation of him: One of the firſt ſignes of ſpiritual life in <hi>Paul</hi> was ſpiritual breathing; Behold he prayeth, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6. and it is obſervable, that prayer is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the ending almoſt of all his Epiſtles: And <hi>David</hi> was three times a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.17. nay ſeven times a day, at this bleſſed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.164. yea, he was ſo wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in it, that he ſpeaketh as if he were altogether made up of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109, 4.<note place="margin">Et ego ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.

Lip-labour doth no more than a windie inſtrument, makes a loud noiſe, and that is all.

            <p>It were eaſie to inſtance how fiery and fervent the children of God, in whom was this ſpirit of God (which is compared to fire) have been in their ſupplications: look <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24, 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 77. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 88. <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled with God, and would not let him go, unleſſe he bleſſed him; Chriſt ſeemed willing to ſhake him off; <hi>Let me go,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: <hi>I will not let thee go, unleſſe thou bleſſe me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob.</hi> My limbs may go, my life may go, but no going for thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a pawn, without a bleſſing.

And this is the difference betwixt the prayer of a living and a dead Chriſtian, the prayer of the former is inſtant and fervent, not diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but rather increaſing by oppoſition; as lime by water caſt upon it burneth the hotter, (ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.22. and 25.27.) the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:38111:126"/> latter is flat and indifferent, eaſily put off, though it be with a crum inſtead of a crown, with a bubble, a butterfly, inſtead of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting fruition of God. Any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good is ſatisfying to them that have no true ſpiritual good in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.5. And the reaſon is clear, the breath of a pair of bellows is cold, becauſe it doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a living principle within, but the breath of a man is warm, becauſe it cometh from a principle of life within; ſo the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the breath of an hypocrite is cold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth not flow from the ſpirit of God, the onely inward principle of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al life; but the prayer, the breath of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Saint is warm, is fervent, becauſe it proceedeth from this living principle, the ſpirit of Chriſt within. Indeed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian knoweth not how to pray as he ought, but the ſpirit helpeth his infirmities with ſighs and groanings, which cannot be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.

            </p>
            <p>He never taketh his leave of prayer, till he is entering into the place of praiſe. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is his element, he cannot live without it, and communion with God in it. Prayer is the veſſel, by which he is continually tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into the Holy Land; he ſendeth it out fraught with precious graces, faith, hope, deſire, love, godly ſorrow, and the like; and it commeth home many times richly laden with peace, joy, and increaſe of grace. But now an hypocrite, <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>will not pray alwayes, he will not alwayes call upon God, Job</hi> 27.10. poſſibly he may ſometimes cry out (as a Scholar undet the rod, or a Malefactor upon the Rack) for deliverance out of ſome affliction; but when God openeth his hand, and beſtoweth the mercy, his mouth is ſhut, and his heart too, that you ſhall hear but little more of this duty. If he pray on his ſick bed, and God raiſe him up, he leaves his prayers ſick a bed behind him. His prayer was but a meſſenger ſent about ſome particular errand; when that is done, the meſſenger returneth: As that ſtory of the Friar ſpeaketh, how when he was a poor Friar, he went ever ſadly, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:38111:127"/> his eyes upon the ground; but being Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, he went merrily, looking upward; one of his companions asked him the reaſon of that alteration; he anſwered, that when he was a common Friar, he went dejected by looking downward for the keys of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, which now he had found, and therefore left that poſture.</p>
            <p>So when an hypocrite hath the temporal good thing he deſireth, (for that uſually is moſt deſired by him) he hath his ends, and his prayer an end too.</p>
            <p>Or if God do not hear him preſently, he will not ſubmit patiently, but often fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away in a rage, with that wicked King, <hi>Why ſhould he wait upon the Lord any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there come not in preſent profit, he will give over his trade; as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid to his Brother, That he would pray to the Gods, but that they have given over to hear. Whereas a godly man will cry in the day, and not be ſilent in the night; <hi>he will direct his prayer to God, und look up, Pſal.</hi> 5.3. He will pray and wait, wait and pray, as you ſee beggars in ſome places, they will beg and knit, knit and beg, and continue ſtill begging and knitting: So a right beggar at Gods

The great and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry priviledges beſtowed on thee, do call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud for gracious and extraordinary practices from thee. How exemplary ſhouldſt thou live among men, who art to live eternally with God? What ſingular things wilt thou do for that God, for that Saviour, that hath done ſuch ſingular things for thy ſoul? Can any love be too much? Can any labour be too great? Can any honor be too high? Can any ſervice be too holy for that God, to whom thou art by millions of eternal obligations thus infinitely infinitely bound? O let the fruitfulneſs of thy heart and life in holineſs proclaim thine abundant thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for ſuch mercies as for weight and worth exceed the very thoughts of Men and Angels: How abundant ſhouldſt thou be in the work of the Lord, when thou knoweſt that thy labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord? When thou art confeſſing thy ſins, meditate on the chooſing calling love of that God, againſt whom thy ſins are
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:38111:128"/> committed, and try whether the heat of that burning love will not thaw thy heart, and diſſolve it into tears, when it is moſt hard and icie. When thou art backward to a duty that hath ſome difficulty in it, conſider Jeſus Chriſt was not backward to his bitter bloody ſufferings for thy ſins. As the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier told <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> when he denied his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I did not ſerve you ſo at the battel of <hi>Actium:</hi> So ſay to thy ſoul, Jeſus Chriſt did not ſerve thee ſo, when he was to drink the cup of his Fathers fierce wrath for thee; and ſee whether ſuch melting perſwaſions will not prevail with thee to ſubject thy ſelf to the hardeſt precept.

As <hi>Antigonus,</hi> being invited to a place, that might probably prove a temptation to ſin, asked counſel of <hi>Menedemus,</hi> what he ſhould do? He bade him only remember he was a Kings Son: So do thou remember thine high and heavenly calling, and do nothing unworthy of the God that hath enrolled thy name in the Book of Life, that hath ranſomed thy ſoul with the precious blood
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:38111:129"/> of his Son, and hath ſanctified thee by the effectual operations of his Spirit, but walk worthy of the vocation wherewith and whereunto thou art called, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1.</p>
            <p>It is an excellent meditation of <hi>Euſebius Emiſſenus;</hi> Though the Devil, ſaith he, ſhould be damned for many ſins, and I but for one, yet mine would exceed the Devils impiety; they never ſinned againſt a God that became an Angel for them; they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinned againſt a Mediator that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for them; but miſerable and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I (and its wonderful that my heart melteth not when it thinketh on it) I have ſinned againſt a God that became a Man for me, againſt a God that died an ignominious death for me; againſt a God that hath left me an example of love and holineſſe. I am more unworthy then the Devils.</p>
            <p>Conſider it Friend; no ſins admit of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aggravations, nor are matter of deeper provocation, then the ſins of thoſe that are intereſted in Gods ſpecial diſtinguiſhing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. In a word (for I had not thought to have told thee ſo much, it was for the ſake of others principally that I penn'd this piece) ſince it ſhall be thy reward to be

Our Saviour indeed doth not ſpeak of an impoſſibility, but of the difficulty of it, and the rareneſſe of it. <hi>Job</hi> unfolded the riddle, and got
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:38111:135"/> through the needles eye with three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Camels; but it is hard to be wealthy and not wanton; too too often are riches like bird-lime, hindering the ſoul in its flight towards Heaven; a load of earth hath ſunk many a ſoul to hell; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of the outward occaſioned the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhing of the inward man. A rich man is a rare diſh at heavens table: Bleſſed be God there are ſome, but ſurely few rich of thoſe very few that ſhall be ſaved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. The weighty burden in a veſſel, though it conſiſted of the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious commodities, hath not ſeldom cauſed its miſcarriage, when otherwiſe it had arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſafely at its deſired haven.

Take heed thou be not like the Horſe and Mule, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32.9. to drink plentifully of the ſtreames, and never look to the Fountain; but let thine eyes, as the Churches, be Doves eyes; <hi>When the Dove hath pecked her corn, ſhe turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

One King knowing this, being called to be King, did not as others prodigally ſpend his revenues, but heaped up all the treaſure he could get together, and ſent it before to that place whither he ſhould be baniſht; and ſo in the year of his Government made a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proviſion for his whole life: So wiſe are they that lay up a treaſure in Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the time of their departure out of this world.</p>
            <p>Art thou poor? Labour for this ſpiritual life, it will make thee rich indeed. Thou haſt little on earth, but thou mayſt have a treaſure in heaven.

But thou muſt be one of Gods poor, not of the Devils ragged Regiment: Will it not be ſad for thee to have two hels: one on earth, in cold, hunger, and thirſt, and wants, and another in hell, in heat, and unſpeakable woe? How many of thy condition ſerve the Devil and the world all their dayes in drudgery and ſlavery, and are turned into

            <p>Where our Saviour doth not indeed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely forbid labour for the body, but comparatively; thy labour for thy ſoul ſhould be ſo much, ſo great, that thy labour for thy body ſhould be no labour at all, not deſerve the name of labour in compariſon of it. Now conſider, what anſwer thou wilt make to the great God, when he ſhall plead with thee for the breach of theſe commands; beſides, haſt not thou many ſpare hours in many evenings, and on wet dayes, wherein thou mightſt go to God in ſecret, and with thy family, and humble thy ſoul in a mournful confeſſion of thy ſins, and ſenſible apprehenſion of the wrath which is due to thee, and wherein thou mightſt be importunate for pardon and grace, without which thou art loſt for ever? Nay, the Lord knoweth how many Lords dayes thou haſt enjoyed, which dayes he hath ſet apart, as well out of mercy as out of ſoveraignity, not only for the glory of his Name, but alſo for the good of thy ſoul, wherein thou mightſt both publickly, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and ſecretly have furthered thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal good; but how doſt thou ſquander away thoſe precious hours, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in corporal labour; alwayes in ſpiritual

            <p>But laſtly tell me, haſt thou time to eat, and drink, and work, and ſleep, and no time to work out thy ſalvation, to fit thy ſoul for death, for judgement, for eternity? If thy houſe were in a flame thou wouldſt not let it burn, and ſay, I have no time to quench it: If thy neighbor call thee to ſit, or talk, or dine, or it may be to go to the Ale-houſe with him, thou doſt not anſwer him, I muſt provide for my family, I have no time; but when thy Maker and Preſerver, the bleſſed God, calleth upon thee by his Spirit and Word to be diligent, for the making thy calling and election ſure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. thou muſt provide for thy family, thou haſt no time for this.

            <p>Reader I have two things to deſire of thee, before I deliver thee the directions which I have received of the Lord for thee; and indeed unleſſe thou grant me, or rather God and thy ſoul, theſe two requeſts, all that I have to ſay will be to no purpoſe at all; my requeſts are, that thou wouldſt follow the counſel of God in order to the recovery of thy ſoul out of its bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe miſery with all ſpeed, and with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Now becauſe they are of ſuch exceeding importance, that if thou art once perſwaded to them, my work will be half effected; and becauſe delayes and lazineſs are the two great gulphs, in which ſuch multitudes of ſouls are drowned and periſh, I ſhall ſpeak the more to them.</p>
            <p>My firſt requeſt to thee is, that thou wouldſt preſently ſet about the affairs of thy ſoul. We ſay of things that muſt be done,<note place="margin">De rebus neceſſariis non eſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberandum</note> there needeth not any deliberation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. Is not this the one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to prepare for the laſt hour, to make ſure of thine everlaſting well-fare?<note place="margin">In re tam juſta nulla eſt conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio.</note> If thou believeſt the word of God, thou wilt not give the fleſh ſo much breath as to debate it; muchleſs wilt thou as <hi>Felix</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:38111:138"/> did, put off the thoughts of righteouſneſs, and judgement to come, till thou art at better leiſure, till thou haſt a more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſeaſon. What more weighty work haſt thou to do, then to work out thy own ſalvation? Is the following thy calling, hoarding up an heaps of earth, feeding, cloathing that fleſh which ſhall ſhortly be food for worms, is any of theſe half ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as thy proviſion for eternity?</p>
            <p>If thou art old, its high time to begin to prepare for thy latter end. Thou haſt the feet of thy body almoſt already in the earth, in the grave; and hadſt thou not need have the feet of thy ſoul, thy affections in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Thou haſt but a little time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with men; doth it not behove thee to be much in communion with God? Death often (poſſibly) knocketh at thy door by the hand of ſickneſs, and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee to look after another habitation, for thou art to be turned out of thy houſe of clay; Doſt thou take warning? what wilt thou do, if thou ſhouldeſt dye before thou didſt ever begin to live? If the Sun of thy life ſhould ſet, before the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs hath ariſen on thee, all the while thou liveſt thou art dead, and thou
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:38111:139"/> liveſt long to add to thy torments, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have died ſoon to haſten them. Thou art but like ſtubble, laid out a drying to burn the better in hell, all the while thou continueſt a ſtranger to the new birth.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt every day been treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath; been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering as it were more wood to increaſe thoſe flames in which thou (if thou thus dieſt) ſhalt live for ever. <hi>Becauſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt an evil work is not ſpeedily exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil; though a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do evil an hundred times, and his dayes be prolonged, it ſhall not go well with the wicked,</hi> Eccleſ. 8 11, 12, 23. <hi>The ſinner an hundred years old ſhall be accurſed,</hi> Iſa. 65.20.</p>
            <p>I have read of the <hi>Circaſsians,</hi> a kind of mungrel Chriſtians, that they divide their time betwixt the Devil and God, dedicating their youth to robbery, and their old age to repentance. How much time haſt thou ſpent in the ſervice of ſin? how little time haſt thou left the ſervice of God and thy ſoul? Is it not high time for thee to number thy dayes, and to apply thy heart unto wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſpeedily?</p>
            <p>Old ſinner, doſt thou not tremble, to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:38111:139"/> think that there is but a ſtep betwixt thee and death! nay betwixt thee and hell. O the time, and talents, and opportunities which thou haſt to reckon for, more then others! Happy, happy had it been for thee to have been turned out of the wombe into hell, rather then to dye an old man, and not a babe in Chriſt. If thou haſt a ſparke of love to thy ſelf, mind thine inward change preſently, leaſt thy change come, even death, and ſend thee to unchangeable miſery.</p>

The firſtlings are his darlings, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. and that cloth will keep colour beſt that is died in the Wool; the veſſel will ſente longeſt of that liquor with which it is firſt ſeaſoned; let thy ſoul like <hi>Gideons</hi> Fleece drink up betimes the dews of grace. As young as thou art, thy life is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment at the mercy of the Lord; There is a ſaying, that in <hi>Golgatha</hi> there are skulls of all ſizes; In the Church-yard thou mayeſt ſee graves of all ſorts, and ſome of thy very length; thou art concerned

This calleth for the greater care and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. In the Iſle of <hi>Man</hi> the maides ſpin their winding ſheets the firſt thing they ſpin; do thou in youth and health ponder and prepare for thy death, leſt as young and ſtrong as thou art, death trip up thy heels and throw thee, and it prove thine everlaſting overthrow.</p>
            <p>Beſides, canſt thou imagine that ſuch a ſinner deſerveth favor who cometh in to ſerve God at laſt, when he can ſerve his luſt no longer? Is it equal (be thy own judge) to give the flower of thine age, the ſpring of thy life, the beſt of thy time, thine health and ſtrength to the devil, and thy brutiſh fleſh; and to give the dregs, the ſnuffe, the bottom of all this to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely glorious God, whoſe creature thou art, at whoſe coſt and charge thou liveſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day and night, and who calleth upon thee for thy ſervice, not for the need he hath of thee, but becauſe of the need thou
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:38111:140"/> ſtandeſt in of him, all whoſe happineſs doth conſiſt in the pleaſing and enjoying his Majeſty?</p>
            <p>Whoever thou art, of what age ſoever, either ſet ſpeedily about thy ſoul-work, or anſwer theſe few queſtions the Lord ſhall put to thee, or be ſpeechleſs and without excuſe at the day of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Hath not God waited upon thee long enough already? wouldſt have him whom the heavens and the heaven of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens cannot contain, who hath millions of glorious Angels waiting on his Majeſty, to wait on thee miſerable worme al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes?</p>
            <p>I tell thee all the while thou art ſinning, his eyes behold thee, his heart is incenſed againſt thee, and his hand can reach thee and avenge him on thee every moment. How many hath he ſent into hell, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taſted of his patience as thou haſt done? The angels ſinned and were not waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one hour for their repentance; yet how many years hath he endured thee with much long-ſuffering, and ſtill waiteth upon thee that he may be gracious unto thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. The laſt oath thou didſt ſwear he
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:38111:141"/> could have curſed and rotted thy tongue. The laſt time that thou wenteſt prayerleſs to thy reſt, he could have ſent thee to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eaſe, to the place where there is no reſt day or night. The laſt time thou didſt quench the motions of his Spirit, and ſtifle the convictions of thy conſcience, he could have taught thee by experience, what is the meaning of the worm that never dyeth, and the fire that goeth not out; and yet he ſpareth thee, ſtretching out his hands all the day long to a rebellious child, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.2. Should not his long patience quicken thee to ſpeedy repentance? Anſwer God whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath not waited enough, been long-ſuffering enough already; and if he have not, continue in thy ungodly courſe, and ſee who ſhall ſuffer longeſt at laſt, he or thou. It is one thing to forbear a debt, another thing to forgive the debtor. The longer God is in fetching his hand about, the heavier his blow will be when he ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The threatning is like a child, the longer it is kept in the womb, the bigger it groweth, and it will put thee to the more pain, when it cometh to the birth of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; therefore bethink thy ſelf before the decree bring forth, before the day

            <p n="1">1. Suppoſe thou hadſt ſeen the Son of man, who now ſitteth at his Fathers right hand, riſing from his place, and attended with the thouſand thouſands that are before him, and with the ten thouſand times ten thouſand that miniſter to him, coming and ſparkling ſo gloriouſly through the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he dazaleth the very eyes of the Sun, and makes him to hide his head for ſhame, and ſitting down in the cloudes, with the glory of his Father, a fire devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him, and behind him a flame burning:</p>
            <p>Conceive now with me, that thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt him call to the Archangel, Sound the laſt Trump, that the dead may ariſe and come to judgement: Harke to the ſound of the Trump, how it rendeth rocks, melteth mountains, breaks in pieces the bands of death, and burſts aſunder the gates of hell, how it pierceth the ocean, and fetcheth from the bottom of the ſea, the duſt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſeed; how it deſcendeth into the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:38111:147"/> belly of the earth, and forceth it to vomit up all the bodies which it had ever taken down, how it openeth the marble tombs of Princes and Potentates, and makes their Highneſs and Majeſty ſtoop as low as the meaneſt, to the King of glory.</p>
            <p>Doſt thou not ſee the bodies of the Saints? look how they flie upon the wings of the wind to their ſouls, and both to the boſom of their beloved Saviour. See how the ſpirits of unregenerate ones leave for a little while, the dark vault of hell, and enter (though moſt unwillingly) into the ſtinking carrion of their bodies, and both haled by angels to the judgement ſeat of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When the Court is thus ſet, conceive the Commiſſion read, wherein Jeſus Chriſt is authorized, in his humane nature, by his Divine Power, to be Judge of the quick and dead; the law is produced, both of nature and Scripture; the books are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hoth of Gods omniſcience and mans conſcience, by which all men are to be tryed for their everlaſting lives and deaths.</p>
            <p>The holy ones are now called, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:38111:148"/> acquitted by publike proclamation, before God, Angels and men, their performances, duties, graces, ſervices, ſufferings, punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally related, to their glory, and infinitely rewarded in their perfect freedom from all evil, and eternal fruition of the chiefeſt good.</p>
            <p>Behold, how the unholy are with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence draged to the bar, examined ſtrictly by the covenant of works, have all their ſins, ſecret, open, perſonal, relative, of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and practice, in thoughts, words, and deeds revealed publikely, and aggravated fully with all their crimſon crying bloody circumſtances; heark how pitifully they plead, what poor evidences they had for ſalvation; what ſorry excuſes for their Atheiſme and abominations; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience inſtead of a thouſand witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes accuſeth them, the law caſteth them, the Judge pronounceth againſt them a moſt ſevere ſentence of condemnation; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils feiſe on them for its ſpeedy execution; Now what confuſion and ſhame of face, what lamentation and forrow of heart poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth them? what doleful ſcreechings? what bitter yellow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:38111:148"/> being ſo ungodly a guide, and ſoul curſing the body for being ſo unready an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and both curſing the time that ever they met together, and wiſhing (though in vain) that they might for ever be parted aſunder.</p>
            <p>Now the worldling curſeth his flocks and his Farm, his gold and his ſilver, that had more of his heart, and of his care and time then his precious ſoul. Now the lazy Chriſtian curſeth his madneſs and folly, that he ſhould think a little formal prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration were ſufficient for ſuch a ſtrict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. A bloody husband haſt thou been to me, ſaith the wife, thou mindedſt proviſion for me for a little time, and never regardedſt my inſtruction about the things of eternity. A cruel father haſt thou been to me, ſaith the child, for generating me a child of wrath, an heir of hell, and never endeavoring my regeneration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I might have been a child of God and an heir of heaven: and thus curſing, crying, roaring, raging, they are ſent to the place where is mourning without mirth, ſorrow without ſolace, darkneſs without light, death without life, pure wrath without mixture, perfect pain without meaſure, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:38111:149"/> but weeping and wailing, ſighing, ſobbing and gnaſhing of teeth for ever, ever, ever.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe I ſay that thou hadſt heard and ſeen all this, and God ſhould after it try thee in this world fourty years, wouldſt thou not night and day be ſtrugling and ſtriving with God by prayer, watching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy own heart, waiting upon thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? With what earneſtneſs wouldſt thou pray? with what ſeriouſneſs wouldſt thou read and hear? with what exactneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarineſs wouldſt thou live? how dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and laborious wouldſt thou be in a faithful improvement of all thy time, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and opportunities, that thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt find mercy at ſuch a day, even the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life! Wouldſt thou after ſuch a ſight think any time too much, or any pains too great, for thy eternal good? Couldſt thou give the world and the fleſh, the choiceſt place in thy heart, and the chiefeſt part of thy life as now thou doſt? ſhouldſt thou dare to be nibbling again at the devils baits, or to be playing with the eternal fire, or to put off God with a few cold formal prayers, and that by fits, in ſtead of hearty, fiery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:38111:149"/> ſupplication? or to put off Jeſus Chriſt with a complement, that thou weareſt his livery, and profeſſeſt thy ſelf a Chriſtian, in ſtead of a ſincere reſolved de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of heart and life to his word and law. What ſaiſt thou man? And why wilt thou not be as diligent and as holy now? thou maiſt in the glaſs of Scripture ſee all that I have ſpoken (for the ſubſtance of it at leaſt) if thou haſt but an eye of faith; and without queſtion the ſight of faith is as ſure and true as a ſight of ſenſe; what reaſon canſt thou have, why thou ſhouldſt not work as induſtriouſly to eſcape hell, and obtain heaven, as if thou hadſt known theſe things experimentally, when the word of the living and true God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſo expreſly? look 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.13. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.2. <hi>ult. verſ.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe thou wer't ſure to die this day come moneth, and take poſſeſſion of thine eternal eſtate, to do that which thou never didſt before, nor ſhalt ever do again; even to throw thy laſt caſt for eternity, wouldſt thou not then lay aſide all other matters, and make it thy onely buſineſs to enſure an intereſt in Chriſt, and to make
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:38111:150"/> ſure of a regenerated ſanctified nature? wouldſt thou not then think, Well now, there is no daubing, no dallying any longer, I am now going to my long long everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home; if I now deceive my ſelf with any thing in ſtead of the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and miſtake at death, I ſhall miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ever; if I be not then right, I ſhall be wrong for ever. <hi>Now or never, now and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wouldſt thou not highly prize every week of that moneth, every day of thoſe weeks, every hour of thoſe dayes, yea and every minute of thoſe hours, and ſay, Ah, deſperate folly to leave a work of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite weight (for which my whole life was little little enough) to ſo ſhort a ſpace; and yet O infinite mercy, that I have any ſeaſons of grace left, wherein I may yet work out my ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling? How wouldſt thou labor as for life in this duty, and that ordinance, hanging on thoſe breſts, and tugging hard for ſome ſpiritual good! Wouldſt thou not with <hi>Jacob</hi> wraſtle with God, weep and make ſupplication? wouldſt thou not with the Ninivites cry mightily unto God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? How would thy prayers proceed from
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:38111:150"/> the very bottom of thy heart? and with what force would they pierce the very heavens? how wouldſt thou with the Bereans ſearch the Scriptutes? and ſee upon what termes Chriſt and heaven may be had. Wouldſt thou not ſtrive to break thy heart with the hammer of the law, and to melt it with the Sun ſhine of the Goſpel, that thou mighteſt repent? Wouldſt thou not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thy ſoul from the freeneſs of Gods mercy, the fulneſs of Chriſts merit to believe? O what ſad thoughts wouldſt thou now have of thy ſoul, and thy ſins? what ſerious thoughts wouldſt thou have of God, and Chriſt, of hell, and heaven, of death and judgement? Surely other manner of thoughts then now thou haſt.</p>
            <p>Thus friend it would be with thee if thou wert to leave this world within a month, or thou wert worſe then a mad man. And why ſhall it not be thus with thee now, when thou art ſo far from enſuring thy life for a moneth, that thou canſt not promiſe thy ſelf the next hour? doſt thou not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that thy foundation is in the duſt? <hi>Job</hi> 4.19. that man at his beſt eſtate is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanity? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. that one dyeth in

Thou art not a tenant at thy own will, whilſt thou dwelleſt in thy houſe of clay. Thou cutteſt large thongs of Gods time, if thou aſſureſt thy ſelf another week. But look, Reader, doſt thou not ſee that eternity is at the very threſhold of thy houſe,<note place="margin">Mortalium nemo eſt qui craſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſibi audeat pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lireri, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripid.</hi>
               </note> that there is but a ſtep, a thin paper wall of life, between thee and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity!

            <p>There is a bird peculiar to <hi>Ireland,</hi> called the Cock of the wood, remarkable for its fine fleſh and folly; all the difficulty to kill them, is to finde them; they flie in woods in flocks; and if one be ſhot, the reſt remove not but to the next tree, and there ſtand ſtaring at the ſhooter, till the whole covey be deſtroyed; yet as fooliſh as this bird is, it may be the Embleme of moſt wiſe men in point of mortality; death ſweeps away one and one, and one and another, and all the reſt remain no whit moved, till at

            <p n="3">3. Suppoſe thou couldſt ſpeak with thy carnal unregenerate neighbors or friends, that are now under endleſs remorſe, frying in thoſe unquenchable flames, and ſhouldſt ask them what cauſed them to miſcarry for ever, and how they came to that place of torment; and they ſhould tell thee, O friend, I thought heaven might have been had without ſo much ado, that there had been no need of that ſeriouſneſs and laboriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which a few preciſe ones practiſed, and which Miniſters ſo much preſſed.

            <p>Shouldſt thou not be laborious in the ſervice of ſuch a good God? Give me leave to urge this thought a little farther, and to give thee a Scripture or two, which through the free grace of God have ſometimes help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me againſt deadneſs and dullneſs in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

I have ſometime read a ſtory of a King that was ever penſive, and never ſeen to ſmile, and being asked by his Brother the cauſe of it, he put him off till the next day for an anſwer; and in the mean time cauſed a

His Brother coming next day for an anſwer, was placed at the board, and four men with drawn ſwords about him, and with all the beſt muſick that could be had to play before him: Then the King called to him, ſaying, Rejoyce and be merry Brother, eat, drink, and laugh, for here is pleaſant being. But he replied, O my Lord and King, how can I be merry, being in ſuch danger on every ſide? Then ſaid the King, Look how it is now with thee, ſo it is alwayes with me; for If I look above me, I ſee the great and dreadful Judge, to whom I muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all my thoughts, words, and deeds; if I look under me, I ſee the endleſſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell, whereinto I ſhall be caſt if I die in my ſins; if I look behind me, I ſee all the ſins which I have committed, and the time which I have ſpent unprofitably; if I look before me, I ſee death every day draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer and nearer unto me; if I look on

            <p>Reader, thou mayſt by all this ſee the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of knowledge, if ever thou wouldſt be converted and ſaved. The Devil (as I ſaid before) carrieth men hood-winkt to hell; but God will never carry thee blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold to heaven: The end of a Saint is the inheritance in light, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. and the way thither is a way of light; <hi>The path of the juſt is as ſhining light, Prov.</hi> 4.18. and ſurely in reſpect of knowledge as well as in other reſpects. Do not pleaſe thy ſelf, that though thou art not book-learned, yet thou haſt as good an heart as others (as thy fooliſh ignorant neighbors will prate) for when thou thus ſpeakeſt, thou ſpeakeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide thy book; for the Book of God telleth us otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſoul without knowledge is not good, Proverbs</hi> 19.2. There may be a clear
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:38111:157"/> head without a clean heart, the light of knowledge without the heat of grace; but a gracious heart in a grown perſon not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, was ever accompanied with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of knowledge in the head. And indeed knowledge is ſo near a kin to grace, that it is often in the Word of God put for it, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>It is life eternal to know thee to be the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.11.</p>
            <p>If thou would be ſanctified and ſaved, get knowledge, <hi>ſeek knowledge as ſilver, and ſearch for it as for hid treaſure, Prov.</hi> 2.3, 4.

It may be the Spirit may cauſe him, as it were, to ſee the ſmoak that aſcendeth from the bottomleſſe pit, to ſmell the ſcent of that infernal brimſtone, and fire; to hear the roarings and howlings of the damned; nay poſſibly to feel a very hell in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The Spirit indeed is a free Agent, and worketh in what manner and meaſure he pleaſeth: But this is certain, he convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:38111:158"/> all of their ſins and miſeries; convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth go before converſion. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian of ſouls will heal none, but ſuch as know both their diſtemper and their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and thereby how infinitely they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to him for their cure; As in the firſt creation one of the firſt thing God made was light; ſo in the forming the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture illumination is before ſanctification, Every one is able to ſay in Chriſt as he in the Goſpel, <hi>This I know, whereas I was blind, now I ſee, John</hi> 9.25.</p>
            <p>This is abſolutely neceſſary in order to the ſecond direction I have to commend to thee; which is the ſincere humiliation of thy ſoul. There muſt be a day-break of light in the underſtanding, before there can be an heart-break of ſorrow in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; till ſin and wrath be diſcerned by knowledge in the mind, they will be no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the conſcience, nor grief to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: As no good wrapt up in darkneſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites deſire, ſo no evil ſwathed up in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſtriketh terror. We may obſerve this by the holy Apoſtles expreſſion; <hi>I was alive without the law, but when the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came, ſin revived and I died,</hi> Rom. 7.9. <hi>i. e.</hi> the time was that I was ignorant both
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:38111:159"/> of the laws ſtrictneſſe and my own ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and then I thought my ſelf to be very ſafe, my conſcience was very quiet, and my heart full of hope (or more properly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption) about my future eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; thus I was alive without the law; but when my eyes were inlightned, to ſee how exceeding broad the Commandements of God were, and that once I compared my crooked race with that ſtrait rule, and took notice how far ſhort I came of that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which the law required, I was then a dead, a loſt man; I quickly pulled in my plumes, and took down my ſails, with which I was haſtening in my conceit to Heaven; for I found that I was in very deed in the road to hell. <hi>When the Commandement came, ſin revived and I died:</hi> There was then life enough in my luſts to wound me unto death, for I dyed.</p>
            <p>Reader, if thou art convinced ſo farre of the abſolute neceſſity of converſion, as to deſire it unfeignedly, let me requeſt thee, for the ſake of thy poor ſoul, to ſet ſome conſiderable time apart; thy body hath had many years; ſurely thy ſoul deſerveth one day, and that ſpeedily, to be ſerious in about its endleſſe eſtate, and to compare
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:38111:159"/> thy wicked life with the pure Law of God, and obſerve how exceedingly thou haſt ſwerved from the precepts therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; conſider not only its outward and literal, but likewiſe its inward and ſpiritual meaning, and thou mayſt preſently diſcern, that thy whole converſation for ſo many years as thou haſt lived, hath been a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued aberration and wandring from the Lord and his Laws. If thou lookeſt aright in that glaſſe, it will diſcover all the ſpots, all the dirt, that have been in the face of thy heart and life, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.23. <hi>By the Law is the knowledge of ſin,</hi> Rom. 3.20.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo, that thy breach of the Law makes thee liable to the curſe of the Law, which is the infinite eternal wrath of the Law-giver. <hi>Curſed is every one that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10.</p>
            <p>The Law muſt be ſatisfied; ſince not in its accompliſhment, it will in thy puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>If God caſt the glorious Angels out of heaven and reſerved them in chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to the judgement of the great day for one ſin, and that (as ſome think) in thought; into what an hell may he caſt thee, whoſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:38111:160"/> iniquities for weight are like the ſand of the ſea, and for number like the ſparks of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and the ſtars in the firmament! Think of it with all poſſible ſeriouſneſſe; thou hangeſt over the mouth of hell every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a ſmall thread of life, and if that ſhould be cut aſunder, the whole world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſave thee from dropping into it.</p>
            <p n="2">

Humiliation muſt follow Illumination. It is not enough for this knowledge of the tranſgreſſions thou haſt committed, and the wrath thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, to ſwim in thy head (it may be there as fire in the flint to no profit) but it muſt ſink down into thy heart, and be beaten out into an application of, and lamentation for thy guilt and wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Man is ſo ſinfully ſubtle, that he can bear the hiſtorical knowledge of theſe things in his underſtanding, he can hear the name of ſin and hell, and be no more troubled then at a painted devil, or a tale of purgatory; but when God brings down ſin from being a notion to be an obligation, and entereth an action againſt the ſoul within it ſelf, then
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:38111:160"/> it will begin to melt and mourn under the ſenſe of its ſins and ſufferings. Thus after the Spirt of God hath been a ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, it becometh a ſpirit of bondage; that eye which was before enlightened to ſee the lewdneſſe of his heart and life, cometh now to affect his heart with grief and ſorrow: This we find in thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. when they had heard of their ſin and guilt, they began to recant and repent: <hi>When they heard thoſe things they were pricked to the heart.</hi> The nails which had pierced Chriſts hands now pierce their hearts. It was with them (ſaith one) as if the ſharp points of daggers had been ſtuck or faſtened in their hearts. They wounded themſelves with ſorrow, that ever they had wounded the Lord Jeſus with their ſins.</p>
            <p>The whole life indeed of a true Chriſtian is (in ſome reſpects) a life of repentance: He is often greiving Gods Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is often greived in his own ſpirit: As long as the ſhip leaketh, the pump muſt go. Though the Chriſtian doth not pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or wallow in the mire of ſin every day, as graceleſſe ones do; yet he findeth, that daily his hands contract dirt, and his ſoul
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:38111:161"/> guilt, therefore he muſt daily waſh with faith and repentance.</p>
            <p>Some report of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> that ſhe ſpent thirty years in <hi>Galba</hi> in weeping for her ſins: And <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of himſelf, That he was born for repentance. <hi>Anſelm</hi> telleth us, That with grief he conſidered the whole courſe of his life; I found (<note n="*" place="margin">In lib. meditat.</note> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth he) the infancy of ſin in the ſins of my infancy; the youth and growth of ſin in the ſins of my youth and growth; and the ripeneſſe of all ſin in the ſins of my ripe and perfect age; and then he breaks out into this pathetical expreſſion; What remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thee, wretched man, but that thou ſpend thy whole life in bewayling thy whole life?</p>
            <p>But eſpecially at the time of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans converſion he is to mind contrition; when the veſſel is newly tapt, then it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth moſt freely and plentifully.

            <p>Look therefore, O ſinner, into the book of thy conſcience, and read over the black lines that ſtill are in thy curſed heart, and the bloody leaves of thy wicked life; how long thou haſt lived to little purpoſe, yea, to the killing of thy ſoul for ever; how farre thou haſt been from accompliſhing the end for which thou waſt born, and the errand for which thou waſt ſent into the world. Keep a petty Aſſize in thy heart; preferre a large Bill of Indictment againſt thy ſelf; accuſe and condemn thy ſelf, not only verbally, but cordially, if ever thou wouldſt have Chriſt to acquit thee. Thou haſt ſpent many years in ſinning, and ſhouldſt thou not ſpend ſome hours in ſorrowing? Thou didſt make the ſoul of Jeſus Chriſt ſorrowful unto death; ſhall not therefore thy ſoul be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, when thy ſorrow may be unto life?

The damned feel ſin, it lyeth heavy on their ſouls; couldſt thou lay thy ear to the mouth of that bottomleſſe pit, thou mightſt perceive by their yellowings and howlings, that ſin is ſin in hell, how lightly ſoever it is regarded by men upon earth.

            <p>And art not thou yet weary and heavy laden? Do I ſpeak to a man or a beaſt? to a living creature, or to a rock that will never be moved? If thou haſt a diſeaſe in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, thou canſt greive and complain; and why not for the diſeaſes of thy ſoul? Are not they farre more deadly, more dangerous? If thou loſeſt a child, O what crying and

If thou miſſeſt a good bargain that was offered thee, whereby thou mightſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thy eſtate; or if thou buyeſt or hireſt at too dear a rate how doſt thou beſhrew and befool thy ſelf for it? Haſt thou not ten thouſand times more cauſe to be really and highly diſpleaſed with thy ſelf, and to abhor thy ſelf in duſt and aſhes, that thou ſhouldſt have all the riches, and glory, and pleaſures of the eternal Kingdom tendered to thee with many intreaties, and yet thou haſt refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them for the lying vanities of this world, and for the pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon? Thou haſt denyed Heavens, happineſſe for a bubble, a butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly; all things for nothing. Did ever any fool buy ſo dear, and ſell ſo cheap? Like <hi>Saul,</hi> buſie himſelf in ſeeking Aſſes, when a Kingdom ſought him: Like <hi>Shimei,</hi> ſeek his ſervant, and thereby loſe himſelf. No

            <p>Well Friend, repent timely and truly of this thy folly, for I muſt tell thee, ſhortly it will be too late; if repentance be hid from thy heart now, repentance will be hid from Gods eye then, by whoſe Law thou art now a condemned man already; if thy heart be hardened now in ſinning, the heart of God will ere long be hardened in ſentencing thee to an eternity of ſuffering.</p>
            <p>It is an infinite mercy, that God yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth

            <p>Conſider while thou liveſt in thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of impenitency, thou art a curſed ſinner, and if thou dieſt in it thou art a damned creature; the hand of God which is lifted up in the commination and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, will fall down in execution. If the wrath of a King be as a meſſenger of death, O what then will will the wrath of a God be! As that Chriſtian King of <hi>Hungary</hi> told his brother (that ſprang into his preſence
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:38111:165"/> pale and trembling, becauſe of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner and Deaths-man, that had ſounded his trumpet at his chamber door in the dead time of the night, to call him away to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution) O Brother, thou haſt loved me, and never offended me, and is the ſight of my Executioner ſo dreadful to thee? how then ſhould I a greivous ſinner, fear to be brought to judgement before Jeſus Chriſt? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the day of the Lords wrath is coming, and who ſhall abide it? This terrible fire is kindled; this horrible tempeſt is gathered, and ready to fall on thy head every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Do not put theſe things farre off, as many do, who thereby deprive themſelves of the happy effects which theſe thoughts might produce. A Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non afarre off, though never ſo great, doth no execution; men will not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fall down for fear of it, when once they apprehend it many miles off: Things afarre off, though very big, will ſeem very ſmall: A Starre that is bigger than the whole earth ſeems no bigger than a Torch, being many miles from us. Look therefore on all that miſery that is treated of, in the firſt uſe, as
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:38111:166"/> thy portion, and as nigh to thee, even at the very door; like a Serjeant it waiteth continually to arreſt thee, and hale thee to the priſon of hell. There is not a night in which thou lyeſt down to ſleep, but this roaring Lion of the wrath of God lyeth down beſide thee, and is ready, when thou art aſleep little dreaming of it, to rend thee aſunder, and tear thy ſoul in pieces. In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when thou riſeſt it waiteth upon thee, dogging thee all the day long, whatſoever thou doſt, and following thee like a blood-hound whereſoever thou goeſt; thou mayeſt as ſoon flie from thy ſelf as from it, till thou art effectually humbled for thy ſins, the cauſe of it. And be not inſenſible of it, becauſe it is inviſible to thee. The influences of the Sun are hotteſt among the minerals in the bowels of the earth, where it is not at all viſible, not they ſenſible: So the fire of divine fury is hotteſt where it is not viſible, nor the perſon ſenſible: Though thou mayſt ſee it as plainly in the Scripture, as the Sun at noon day; God is angry with the wicked
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:38111:166"/> every day, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 7.12. There is wrath prepared for the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and it will aſſuredly and ſpeedily be inflicted, if thou art not timely and truly humbled and converted.</p>
            <p>I would alſo deſire thee to ponder much the free grace of God, which is diſcovered in the Goſpel; what bowels of compaſſion in the Father to give his Son; what infinite affection in the Son, to give himſelf for the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation of his enemies. It is probable the heat of this unknown love may melt thy frozen ſpirit: This is the moſt ingenuous ſorrow which is never to be ſorrowed for, which ſpringeth from the conſideration that thou haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt ſo good, ſo pure, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a God, in conformity to whom, and communion with whom, all thy happineſſe conſiſteth. The Law indeed is of excellent uſe to open the ſore, to ſearch the wound, to make the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient feel his need of, and ſet a price upon his Phyſitian; thus it is a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter to drive the ſoul to Chriſt;
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:38111:167"/> but winter fruits are more harſh and ſowre, when ſummer fruits are ſweet and pleaſant. God taketh moſt delight in thoſe tears and ſorrow, which are the fruits of hot love to his bleſſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. And could I ſee them once in thee, I durſt joy thee of thy Babe of Grace, the new Creation. They are at leaſt the kindly bearing throws of one in travail, very near her hour of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as alſo often the after-paines: A ſtroak from guilt, from wrath, broke <hi>Judas</hi> heart into deſpair: A look from love, from Chriſt, broke <hi>Peters</hi> into teares.<note place="margin">Aſpexit Chriſtus &amp; flevit Petrus. <hi>Ambr.</hi>
               </note> That ſap and moiſture which in froſt and ſnow lyeth hid and buried in the earth, ſheweth it ſelf pleaſantly in the fruits of the trees, when it is called forth by the warmth of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Even <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf will lift up his voice, and weep when he ſeeth a clear teſtimony of the love and undeſerved kindneſſe of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Haſt thou never beheld a condemned
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:38111:167"/> priſoner diſſolved into tears, upon the unexpected and unmerited receit of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, who all the time before was as hard as a flint? The hammer of the Law may break the icie heart of man with terrors and horror, and yet it may remain ice ſtill, unchanged: But when the fire of love kindly thaweth this ice, it is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and diſſolved into water, it is no longer ice, but of another nature. Where the Sun is moſt ptedominant, there are the ſweeteſt Spices, the richeſt Mines, and the coſtlieſt Jewels. Do thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meditate much on the love of God and Chriſt to thy unworthy ſoul: Think what love is it that ſtill ſpareth thee, notwithſtanding all thy God-daring and ſoul-damning provocations, and that when others (probably better than thy ſelf) are every day and night ſent to that place, where God hath large intereſt for his long patience. What love is it, not only to forbear thee, but alſo to doe thee good! thou his enemy art hungry, he feedeth thee; thou art thirſty, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thee drink. <hi>If a man find his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my will he let him goe,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.19.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:38111:168"/> but lo God findeth thee every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as all thy ſins are within the reach of his eye, ſo thou thy ſelf art continually within the reach of his arm; he can as eaſily turn thee into hell, as tell thee of hell: And yet he letteth thee goe, and more than that, doth thee good. Thou ſpendeth every hour upon the ſtock of mercy. God is at great charge and much coſt in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meat, and drink, and health, and ſtrength, and time which thou doſt ravel out, and wanton away unprofitably.</p>
            <p>What love was that in the Father which ſent his own Son to die, that thou mightſt live! Well might the beloved Diſciple ſay, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, might not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3.16. In this the bowels of divine love are naked, as in an Anatomy: In other things the love of God is as the beames of the Sun ſcattered, which are warm and comfortable; but in this it is as the beames of the Sun united in a burning-glaſſe,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:38111:168"/> hot fiery burning love; <hi>God ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the world,</hi> ſo dearly, ſo intirely, ſo incomparably, ſo infinitely: It is a <hi>ſic</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>ſicut</hi> (as one obſerveth) a pattern which can never be parallel'd. In this God commended his love towards us, in that when we were ſinners <hi>Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8. when God ſent his Son into the world, he did as it were ſay to him, My dear Son, thou Son of my chiefeſt love and choiceſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, go to the wicked unworthy world, commend me to them, and tell them, that in thee I have ſent them ſuch a love-token, ſuch an unqueſtionable teſtimony of my favour and good-will towards them, that hereafter they ſhall never have the leaſt colour of reaſon to ſuſpect my love, or to ſay, <hi>Wherein haſt thou loved us? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p>What love was that in the Son of God, which moved him to become the ſon of man that thou mightſt become the ſon of God? What love was that which made him ſo willingly undergo the ſcorns, and flouts, and deriſions of wretched men, the rage, and malice, and aſſaults of ravenous devils,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:38111:169"/> the wrath and fury of a righteous God; ſuch pangs and tortures in his body as no mouth can expreſſe, ſuch ſorrows and horror in his ſoul as no minde can conceive; and all that thou mighteſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape ſuch miſery, and obtain everlaſting mercy!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friend,</hi> John 15.13. The paſſion of Chriſt was the greateſt evidence of his affection. The laying down of life did abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his love. His love before was like wine in a cask, hardly ſeen; but O how did it ſparkle and caſt its colour in the glaſs of his ſufferings! This Diamond before hid in the ſhell, doth ſhine radiantly in the ring of his death: If his tears did ſo much ſpeak his love to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that the Jews who ſaw him weeeping, cryed out, Lo how he loved him! ſurely his heart-blood doth far more demonſtrate his love to his members. They that beheld him bleeding in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, had far more reaſon to ſay, Look, lo how he loved his!</p>
            <p>What love is that which did all this for ſuch a worm as thou art? ſuch a ſinner, ſuch
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:38111:169"/> a rebel; what would God loſe, if thou wert eternally loſt? the leaſt tittle of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would not be diminiſhed; this Sun is no loſer, when men ſhut their eyes, and will not behold its light: what gaineth God, if he gain thee to himſelf, to his ſervice? thou canſt not adde the leaſt cubit to the ſtature of his perfections; the refreſhment is to men, not to the Spring when the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſengers drink of it. He doth not command thee to repent from any need he hath of thee, but from the pity he hath to thee. He entreateth thee to return, not that he may be bleſſed and happy, but that he may be bountiful &amp; liberal in beſtowing on thee thoſe bleſſings which accompany ſalvation. Methinks the apprehenſion of Gods great love and goodneſſe ſhould have ſuch an impreſſion on thee as to make thee little and low in thine own thoughts. Is it not a wonder, that God ſhould vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe a gracious look upon ſuch a clod of earth, a piece of clay as thou art? but what admiration can anſwer this love and condeſcenſion, that God ſhould wait and intreat to lift thee up, who wouldſt caſt him down! That an Emperour ſhould ſue to a traitour; that Majeſty ſhould thus ſtoop
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:38111:170"/> to miſery; that the Lord of life and glory ſhould prepare for thee exceeding rich and precious promiſes, a crown of life, a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed poſſeſſion, and beſeech thee to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them. Were thy heart never ſuch hard metal, one would think that ſuch an hot fire of burning love ſhould melt it. I hsve in two or three Authors read of five men that met together, and asked each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what means they uſed to abſtain from ſin? The firſt ſaid, The thoughts of the certainty of death, and uncertainty of the time moved him to live every day, as if it were his laſt day. The ſecond ſaid, He meditated of the day of of judgment, and the torments of hell, and they frighted him from medling with his dangerous enemy, ſin. The third conſidered of the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſin, and beauty of holineſſe. The fourth, of the abundant happineſſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in heaven for holy ones. The laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually thought of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his love; and this made him aſhamed to ſin againſt God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou haſt but any ingenuity, the abuſe of ſuch love and kindneſſe ſhould work upon thee. Some ſay, the blood of a goat will ſoften an Adamant: ſhall not
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:38111:170"/> then the blood of this true goat diſſolve thy adamantine heart? Beaſts themſelves have been won by kindneſſe, and wilt thou be worſe than a beaſt, that ſuch Philanthrophy and kindneſſe of God ſhall no whit ſtir thee or humble thee?</p>
            <p>There is a twofold neceſſity of a deep ſerious humiliation (for which cauſe I have been the more large upon it, though indeed I have added very much more than I firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) in order to the two next directions which I ſhall preſcribe thee.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in order to thy hearty acceptation of Jeſus Chriſt. Humiliation is like <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, to prepare the way of Chriſt before him. Chriſt will not be a Saviour to them that do not ſet an high valuation upon him: now an unhumbled ſinner is a man (concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly) whole, ſeeing no need of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſetting little price upon the Phyſician of ſouls. Till men ſee that they are caſt by the Law of God, and condemn'd men, they will never heartily deſire and value a pſalm of mercy. According to a mans ſenſe of miſery, ſuch is his eſtimation of mercy: When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw himſelf the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of ſinners, then that ſaying, <hi>That Chriſt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:38111:171"/> Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> was worthy of all acceptation. This ſharp ſawce of repentance doth commend Chriſt exceedingly unto the ſpiritual palat: The more bitter and irkſome ſin is, the more ſweet and welcome Jeſus Chriſt will be to the ſoul. When the ſinner ſeeth that he is loſt in himſelf, then (and not till then) will he truly requeſt to be found in Chriſt; the prodigal did not prize the bread in his fathers houſe, till he was ready to periſh for hunger. Miniſters preach much of the infinite excellencies that are in Chriſt, of the unſpeakable miſery of ſinners without Chriſt, of the abſolute neceſſity that men and women ſtand in of Chriſt, and yet preach to little purpoſe; moſt prize their ſhops and their lands, their relations, yea, and their ſenſual luſts above the Lord Jeſus, notwithſtanding all their pretences to the contrary; they ſee no ſuch need of him, nor ſuch worth in him, as the Preachers and Scriptures ſpeak of: What's the reaſon of it? truly this; They were never ſenſible of the ſtings of the fiery ſerpents; if they had, they would look up to the brazen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent with an eye of greater reſpect. They were never pricked to the heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:38111:171"/> cry not out, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> But when God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth his wrath to the ſoul, and ſhutteth the ſoul up under it, when he commandeth conſcience in his Name to arreſt the ſoul for all its debts, which it oweth to divine juſtice; and when in purſuance thereof conſcience doth in the name of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, charge on the ſinner the guilt of all his ſins, and hales him to the Judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat of God, where he ſeeth nothing but frowns and fury, fire and brimſtone, and feeleth nothing but tribulation and anguiſh, indignation and wrath: now the ſinner cryeth out in bitterneſſe of ſpirit, O wretched miſerable man, alas, alas, I am undone! What deſperate madneſſe poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my ſoul thus to provoke the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God by my ſins? Into what a ſea of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery have I brought my ſelf by mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? The God whom I ſee is angry, the wrath which I feel is heavy, the torments which I fear are infinite. The Law which ſheweth no mercy is violated; the God who will have full ſatisfaction for the breach of his law, is incenſed; conſcience which is his Jailour is commiſſionated to wound and terrifie me: And whether ſhall I go?
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:38111:172"/> wrath above me, wrath below me, wrath without me, wrath within me. A world (mark now) for a ſurety to diſcharge me of theſe debts; a thouſand worlds for that balm which can heal this wounded conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Ten thouſand thouſand worlds for a Jeſus that can deliver from the wrath to come. When ſin comes to be ſin indeed, then and not till then a Saviour will be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour indeed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, humiliation is neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the ſouls hearty reſignation of it ſelf, to every Law and Command of Chriſt. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a mans humiliation, ſuch will his ſubjection to Chriſt be; Humilation is (in ſome ſenſe) the foundation of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans obedience; and the ſtrength of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dependeth upon the ſtrength of the foundation. The reaſon why the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious buildings of hundreds of Profeſſors in our dayes (though they have been very fair and beautiful to the eye) have miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried is this, the want of this foundation, their hearts were never throughly humbled. The reaſon why the ſtony ground did not bring forth good fruit, was this, the plough had not gon deep enough, <hi>it did not take
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:38111:172"/> deep root, Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21.</p>
            <p>Men would never dally with God as they do, or halt as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> between two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, be ſometimes for God, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the world; holy by fits and girts, if they had ever felt the weight of ſin. Chriſt when he cometh into the ſoul as a Saviour, will come alſo as a Soveraign to command and govern the whole man; He is the true Sun, and he will have the whole heaven, the whole heart to himſelf; he will allow no writ of partition; his Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth inmates as well as mans. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this,<note place="margin">Probably therefore, fleſhly luſts may be called earthly members. Col. 3. not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they flow from the body of death, but alſo becauſe they are as dear to men as their bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</note> the natural carnal man riſeth and rebelleth exceedingly; He hath ever at this time ſome luſt or other which he valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as his * limbs, ſome right hand that he deſireth may not be cut off, ſome right eye which he would not have pluckt out, ſome <hi>Herodias</hi> that muſt not be medled with, ſome <hi>Abſolom</hi> that the ſinner intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Chriſt to ſpare, and deal gently with for his ſake. Therefore before the Lord of hoſts can make an abſolute conqueſt, before he can perſwade the beſieged ſoul to ſurrender it ſelf wholly and altogether to his government, he is forc'd by the <hi>Granadoes,</hi> and thundring Cannons of the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:38111:173"/> Laws curſe, and Gods wrath, to fire and fright it out of all its ſinful holds. Then it will come up to thoſe excellent terms of the Lord, which are moſt honourable for the Saviour, and moſt profitable for the ſoul. Now he ſeeth moſt certainly ſuch a ſting in ſins tail, that he dares plead no longer for the beauty of its face; Now he feeleth it as a dart in his liver, as an arrow ſticking in his heart, as a coal of fire in his hand; he is heartily willing, yea, thinks himſelf much beholden to that Redeemer that will pluck out this dart, this arrow. O how readily doth he throw away this coal of fire, fearing to be burnt by it any more! We have two famous inſtances of this in Scripture. The one is in <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9.6. When <hi>Paul</hi> that was poſting in the road to hell, comes to be knockt down, and to feel thoſe tremblings and terrors in his ſpirit, he crieth out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> He had probably heard much before of God: but he regarded it not, till now he receiveth a word, and a blow; a word from without, and a wound within to ſet it home; now it is, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> before it was, <hi>What will the high Prieſt, the Scribes and Phariſees have me to do? and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:38111:173"/> what will the vain imaginations, and high thoughts which exalted themſelves againſt God and Chriſt, have me to do?</hi> but now it is, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Before his heart was like hard wax, it would take no impreſſion from God; but now it is ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this fire of inward humiliation, it is ready for any ſtamp. God may imprint what he pleaſeth; <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me do?</hi> The other inſtance is in the cruel, rough, hard-hearted Jaylour; After the earth-quake, and the heart-quake which God had cauſed, <hi>he ſprings trembling in, and fell down before Paul and Silas, crying out, Sirs, What ſhall I do to be ſaved? Acts</hi> 16. 29, 30. Obſerve, now the man is heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick indeed; he is willing to take the moſt bitter pills; As if he had ſaid, Sirs, Do but tell me what I muſt do for ſalvation; though the terms be never ſo hard, the conditions never ſo unpleaſant, the price never ſo much, the pains never ſo great, yet I will ſubmit to any thing, to all things for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Iſraelite firſt ſets out towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> there is a mixt multitude of carnal affections which deſire and endeavour to bear him company; now becauſe God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:38111:174"/> that the land is too good for ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil inhabitants, and beſides that they will cauſe many mutinies in the way, he brings therefore the Iſraelite into the wilderneſſe, to humble him, and to cut them off.</p>
            <p>Before the ſoul be throughly humbled, it dodgeth with Chriſt, it plaies faſt and looſe, off and on; this it liketh, and that it diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; this part of the yoke is uneaſie; this burthen is too heavy, and ſuch and ſuch commandments are grievous; fain it would have Chriſt and his precious promiſes, but loth it is to forego its old friends, its belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved luſts; but when God is pleaſed to take the ſinner by the throat, and to ſhake him out of his ſecurity, by ſhewing him ſin and wrath in their colours, making him ſenſible of the one, and terrifying him with a fearful expectation of the other, laying him at the pits brink, within the ſmoak of hell, within the ſmell of that brimſtone, within the ſorchings of that eternal fire which is prepared for the Devil and his Angles, now the ſinner ſeeth that God is in earneſt, and therefore dareth not halt or halve it any longer; now he is in a boiſterous ſtorm, and caſteth all thoſe goods his darling-ſinnes into the ſea, perceiving
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:38111:174"/> that he muſt periſh if he do not.</p>
            <p>God is neceſſitated to launce mens wounds, and put them to pain, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they cannot be cured. When the metal is thus melted, God may caſt it into what mold he pleaſeth. O thrice happy is that heart which hath been deeply and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled; it ſhall hold out in thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, wherein many others ſhall make ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Direction.</hi> Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt.</note> if thou haſt been faithful in following my former advice, to get thy mind enlightned to ſee, and thy heart throughly humbled for thy ſin and miſery: thy next work is to reſt and rely upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for pardon, grace and ſalvation. To look upon him, as one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the father, given by himſelf, ſanctified by the ſpirit, and revealed in the word of truth, the Goſpel, to be the onely and al-ſufficient Saviour of loſt ſouls. It is now the proper time for thee to caſt thy ſoul, thy ſins, thine eternal eſtate, upon the infinite meritoriouſneſſe of the bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Experience ſheweth, that it is very eaſie for an unbroken ſinner to preſume; but ſurely it is very hard for an humbled ſinner that hath had all his vileneſſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:38111:175"/> diſplayed before his eye, and the infinite wrath of God like a mountain of lead oppreſſing his conſcience, to believe, and therefore I have prepared ſome choice cordials for ſuch fainting ſpirits, which I ſhall give thee anon. But my work now is to beſeech thee, broken heart, that thou take heed of thinking to lick, thy ſelf whole.

               <hi>Reader,</hi> now therefore eſpecially, if thy ſoul be in a flame, be careful out of what well thou draweſt thy water to quench it. This is one of the chiefeſt (nay the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all) fundamentals in Religion; and therefore it behoveth thee to be very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Now thou art nigh drowning, neer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Ocean of divine fury, thou hadſt need to make ſure that the bough or ſtake, or what ever it be by which thou
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:38111:175"/> holdeſt be ſtrong enough, and able to bear thy weight. It is likely, (nay it is certain, if thou art humbled as aforeſaid) thou pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, thou mourneſt, thou ſigheſt, thou loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt thy ſelf for thy wickedneſſe, thou admireſt God for his forbearance, thou longeſt after help and deliverance; be ſure that thou do not look on theſe as ſo much money wherewith thou maieſt purchaſe thy pardon, and buy off thy guilt; for believe it if thou doeſt, as white as thy ſilver is, it will draw black lines, inſtead of wiping off thy old ſcore, thou wilt thereby run fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in debt. Evangelical humiliation is required, not ſo much to make thee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Chriſt, as to make Chriſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thee. It is a good evidence of the beginnings of ſanctification, but it is a bad advocate for thy juſtification. It is as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous to appear before God in the rags of thy own righteouſneſſe, as in thy ſinful nakedneſſe.</p>
            <p>If ever thou receive the bleſſing of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and love from thy heavenly father, it muſt be by appearing in the garments of thine elder brother. He maketh his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but it is in Chriſt the <hi>beloved, Eph.</hi> 1.6. Nothing but perfect righteouſneſſe will
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:38111:176"/> pacifie Gods anger, or ſatisfie his juſtice, or pleaſe thoſe eyes which are purer than to behold the leaſt iniquity: And this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is onely in Chriſt, who was made ſin for thee, that thou mightſt become the <hi>righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do not therefore, when thou ceaſeſt to be an Athieſt, begin to be a Papiſt, in rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon thy good works; for though God will not ſave thee without them, yet he will never ſave thee for them.</p>

            <p>What meaneth his ſorrow for them that refuſe him for their Saviour? <hi>He is grieved becauſe of the hardneſs of mens hearts, Mark</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>He ſhed tears for them that ſhed his blood. When he came nigh that City (which was the ſlaughter-houſe of the Prophets of the Lord, and of the Lord of the Prophets) he wept, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41. If thou hadſt known, even thou in this thy day! The broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſpeech, ſheweth the broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſpirit. He is pitiful towards
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:38111:180"/> their ſouls, that are ſo cruel to themſelves, and weepeth for them that go laughing to hell.</p>
            <p>What meaneth his joy at the birth-day of the new creature, when he is received with wel-come into the ſinners heart? The mother is as much pleaſed that her full breaſts are drawn, as the child can be. The day of thy cordal acceptation of him, will be the day of the gladneſs of his heart; At ſuch an hour he rejoyced in ſpirit, ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.22. He wept twice, and he bled (as ſome affirm) ſeven times; but we never read of his rejoycing, (if I miſtake not) but in this place. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was ſomething that did extraordinarily take the heart of Chriſt, which could in the time of his humiliation tune his ſpirit into a merry note, and cauſe this man of ſorrows to rejoyce. Ah ſinner, believe it, he would never ſo willingly have died ſuch a curſed painful death, if he had not been willing that ſinners ſhould live a ſpiritual and eternal life.</p>
            <p>What mean I ſay his invitations, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations, grief upon refuſal, joy upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, his commands, intreaties, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, threatnings, his woing thee by the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:38111:181"/> Miniſters of his Word, by the motions of his Spirit, by his daily, nightly, hourly mercies, by his gracious providence, by his unwearied patience, but to aſſure thee that he is heartily willing to accept thee for his ſervant, for his ſon, if thou art heartily willing to accept him for thy Saviour, and for thy Soveraign. He would never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thee with ſuch coſtly gifts, if his offer of marriage were not in earneſt: Beſides (broken-hearted ſinner, for 'tis to thee that all this while I have been ſpeaking) how dareſt thou any longer entertain ſuch a Traytour againſt the King of Saints in thy breaſt, as a thought that the Lord Jeſus can be guilty in any of the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed particulars, of the leaſt inſincerity?</p>
            <p>Do not therefore, like the ſilly Hart, go ever up and down, moaning and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the arrow in thy ſide, thy ſinnes ſticking in thy heart, but deſire his helping hand to pluck them out, and without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion thou ſhalt have it. He had a ſpecial command and commiſſion from his Father to remember and redeem thee, to bind up the broken-hearted,<note place="margin">Iſa. 61.1, 2, 3.</note> to proclaim liberty to the captive, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound, to comfort them
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:38111:181"/> that mourn; and doſt thou think it poſſible for him to be unfaithful in his Office, or to his Father? No certainly, he keepeth all his Fathers Commandments and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his love, <hi>John</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>When he was upon earth, like a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, he was in his Element when among ſick and diſeaſed perſons, ſo much did he love to heal and cure: And now he is in heaven, though he be free from paſſion, yet not from compaſſion; his heart piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee moſt tenderly, and his hand will help thee effectually.

If thou expecteſt an immortal life from him, thou muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate thy mortal life to him.

Truly, thus it muſt be with thee, if ever thou art ſaved; and thus I thought to have found thee, at leaſt to leave thee.</p>
            <p>One excellently compareth holineſſe and happineſſe to thoſe two ſiſters, <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel.</hi> Salvation or happineſſe, like <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> ſeems the fairer (even a carnal heart may fall in love with that) but ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or holineſſe, like <hi>Leah</hi> is the elder and beautiful alſo, though in this life it appears with ſome diſadvantage, her eyes being
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:38111:183"/> bleared with tears of repentance, and her face furrowed with the works of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this is the law of that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Countrey, that the younger ſiſter muſt not be beſtowed before the elder; We cannot enjoy fair <hi>Rachel,</hi> heaven and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, except firſt we embrace tender-eyed <hi>Leah,</hi> holineſſe, mortification, ſelf-denial, and all thoſe ſevere duties which the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Law-giver enjoineth.</p>
            <p>Friend, ſit down, and conſider what it may coſt thee to be a Chriſtian. It muſt coſt thee the abſolute denial of thy ſinful carnal ſelf, of the body of death and its earthly members, which are expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the Word of God; and thy main work muſt be every day to crucifie and mortifie them. Sin muſt die (though it may be never ſo dear to thee) or thy Soul cannot live. If thou letteſt any ſin go, ſince every one is appointed by God to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thy life muſt go for its life, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet told <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 Kings 20.42. When Chriſt came in the fleſh, ſin crucified him; but when Chriſt comes in the ſpirit, he will crucifie it. As <hi>Samſon,</hi> an eminent type of Chriſt pull'd down the houſe upon the heads of the Lords of the Philiſtines, that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:38111:183"/> he might ſlay them, and ſo be avenged on them for his two eyes. So Jeſus Chriſt, if he be thy Saviour, is reſolved to pull the houſe in which ſin harbours it ſelf down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout its ears, and by its ſlaughter to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on it for his two eyes, for all the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy and ſhame, agony and pain which ſin put him to; He will teach thee better than to beg the life of thoſe <hi>Barrabaſses,</hi> thoſe ſoul-murderers and robbers of God of his glory. And ſurely ingenuity will learn thee otherwiſe than to expect ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite favours from this King, and yet to entertain in thy heart any that are rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Thus it will coſt thee the abſolute denial of thy ſinful ſelf; It muſt coſt thee the conditional denial of thy natural ſelf, and all that is outwardly dear unto thee; nay, it may coſt thee the actual loſſe of relations, poſſeſſions, honour, pleaſure, liberty, limbs, life, and all theſe for Jeſus Chriſt. Thou muſt reſolve when ever they come in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition unto, or competition with Chriſt his glory, Kingdome and Command, to let them go.

               </note> who thinks to ſave any thing by his

There is certainly (if thou wilt be a Chriſtian indeed) a neceſſity of laying thy health, ſtrength, time, eſtate, name, friends, intereſts, in the world, thy calling and comforts whatſoever, at the feet of Chriſt, to be employed wholly in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and improved altogether for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to be denied or enjoyed in whole, or in part, according to his call and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. This may ſeem an hard ſaying to carnal minds, that rather than break, and leave off all ſhew of trading with God, (to which their ſtirred conſciences will by no means yield) would willingly compound and give Chriſt a part, and the world and fleſh the other part. But as Chriſt is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of, ſo he will have all acceptation. The gods of the Heathen are good fellows, and ſhare their honour among themſelves; but this Lord over all, <hi>who is God bleſſed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> will not give his glory to others; he will not ſuffer that ſuperlative eſteem, truſt, and love of the ſoul, to be beſtowed upon any but himſelf, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to be divided betwixt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:38111:185"/> himſelf and any other. He will allow no ſuperiour, nay, no equal. As <hi>Alexander</hi> anſwered <hi>Darius</hi> (when <hi>Darius</hi> ſent to him about peace, becauſe there were Empires enough in the world to ſatisfie them both) The whole world could endure but one ſun, but one <hi>Alexander;</hi> So the heart of man muſt have but one General, but one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, and that muſt be Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Truly <hi>Reader,</hi> I hope that theſe things will not diſcourage thee from the wayes of God. Do but rationally conſider them; Is it not moſt juſt and equal, that ſince all theſe things come freely from him, that they ſhould be laid out purely for him? Thou giveſt thy ſervant a little meat, and drink, and mony, (or rather God by thee) and what ſervice doſt thou require of him? Thou art inſtrumental (under God) to the birth and breeding of thy children, and what duty doſt thou expect from them? Art not thou ten thouſand times more engaged to Jeſus Chriſt, for every bit of bread and breath of air, for every nights ſleep and days ſupply, for every mercy that thine enjoy, for every moments abode on this ſide hell, for every ſoul-favour, and body-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
            <pb n="193" facs="tcp:38111:185"/>
            <p>In him thou liveſt, moveſt, and haſt thy being; the light doth not ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the Sun, as thy life and all thy comforts depend on Chriſt. Now (be thy own judge) what ſervice, what obedience may the Lord Jeſus look for at thy hands? If the world or the fleſh could do half ſo much for thee, thou wer't more excuſeable, then now thou art in doing ſo much for them.</p>
            <p>Again, when the queſtion ariſeth, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt or the fleſh, Chriſt or the world ſhould have thy greateſt eſteem, or love, or truſt, or the moſt of thy time and ſtrength, and talents; One would think thou ſhouldſt be aſhamed to put ſuch a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or at leaſt, that the very mention of it would be a ſufficient anſwer to it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, what are all the honours and pleaſures, riches and relations, delicates and diadems of the whole world to Jeſus Chriſt, but as pebbles to pearls, dirt to Diamonds, droſs to gold, nothing to all things? there is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no compariſon. The whole world of heaven and earth doth not ſo far excell a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Jeſus Chriſt doth the whole world.</p>
            <pb n="194" facs="tcp:38111:186"/>
            <p>Beſides, this requeſt of mine ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encourage thee, in regard this abſolute reſignation of thy ſelf to Chriſt, tendeth to the perfection and happineſs of thy ſoul. Thy miſery by thy fall is chiefly in this, that thou haſt thereby loſt the Image of God. Thy want of conformity to him, is the cauſe why thou haſt not communion with him. Beaſts do not converſe with men, nor trees with beaſts, becauſe they do not live the life of each other. Senſe muſt fit trees to converſe with beaſts, and reaſon muſt fit beaſts to converſe with men, and grace and holineſs muſt fit thee to converſe with God. When thou once liveſt the life of God, as this unreſerved ſoul-reſignation or ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is called, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. thou mayſt then bathe thy ſoul in his love.</p>
            <p>Now this is the way to it. The life of Chriſtianity conſiſteth in an hearty dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy ſelf and all thou haſt to Chriſt. When thou haſt done this thou art a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian indeed.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:38111:188"/> to condeſcend to become a Suiter to thee, to beſeech thee to accept of him, who knoweth thy portion to be miſery and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, who ſeeth thy perſon to be full of ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and deformity, who gaineth no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his happineſs by thine acceptance of his love, nor ſuffereth the leaſt diminution by thy refuſal. Well, what ſayeſt thou to this match? Art thou heartily willing to take Jeſus Chriſt for thy wedded Husband to protect and direct thee, to purifie and pardon thee, to ſanctifie and ſave thee, to guide thee by his counſel, and afterwards to receive thee to glory? And wilt thou here in the preſence of the Lord, and before thy conſcience, which is as ten thouſand witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, promiſe and covenant to obey him uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, to love him unfainedly, to reſign up thy ſelf, and all thou haſt to his diſpoſal unreſervedly? What ſayeſt thou? Art thou willing or no? Take heed of dallying in a match that is ſo unqueſtionably and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely for thy advantage; Believe it, thou ſhalt not have ſuch offers every day. Doe not ſtick at any of his Precepts, for he can require nothing but what is equal, excellent and honorable: doe not trifle or defer it (if thou loveſt thy ſoul) for this may be the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:38111:189"/> very laſt time of asking. If thou wilt deal kindly and truly with my Maſter, tell me; or if not, tell me, that I may return an anſwer to him that ſent me, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.49.</p>

            <p>Firſt, This ſpiritual life is the moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life. No life hath ſo much excellencie in it, as the life of godlineſſe. If I had my wiſh, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> I would chooſe the homely work of a ruſtical Chriſtian before
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:38111:198"/> all the victories of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> The excellencie and dignitie of every life dependeth upon the form, which is its principle, and its ſpecificating difference. Therefore the life of a man is more noble than the life of a beaſt, becauſe it hath a more noble form, a rational ſoul, which diſtinguiſheth it ſpecifically from, and enableth it to act more nobly and highly than a beaſt. And truly, therefore the life of a Chriſtian is more honorable and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than the life of any other man, becauſe he hath a more noble form (which is the principle of it, and differenceth it ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie from the life of graceleſſe men) Jeſus Chriſt the Lord of life and glory dwelling in his heart, by his Spirit, as the principle of his ſpiritual life. If there be an excellencie in that body which is united to a ſoul, what excellencie is there in that ſoul which is united to a Saviour? It is called <hi>the life of God, Eph.</hi> 4.18. Surely no life can be more honorable than the life of God; yet in their meaſure the ſanctified ones live the very ſame life that the glorious God (the fountain of all true honor) liveth. <hi>David,</hi> though a King, thought himſelf honored by being Gods ſubject; and therefore as others
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:38111:199"/> before their works mention thoſe titles which belong to them, and ſpeak their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, <hi>David</hi> ſtileth himſelf before the ſix and thirtieth <hi>Pſalm a ſervant of God,</hi> as his moſt honorable title,<note place="margin">

            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, That thoſe ſeventie ſouls which went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> were more worth then all the ſeventie Nations of the world beſide. If the glorious Angels in heaven are more honorable than the Devils, ſure I am, it is holineſſe that maketh the difference.</p>
            <p>The moſt gaudy and goodly fruits of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, ſpringing from the ſoil of nature manured and improved to the utmoſt; The Heavens beſpangled with thoſe glittering Stars, and adorned with that illuſtrious Sun,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:38111:200"/> are nothing glorious in compariſon of the heart of a poor Chriſtian that is embroider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grace. It is godlineſſe alone that addeth worth and value to all our civil and natural things, as the Diamond to the Ring. Nothing doth really debaſe and degrade a man but ſin; and nothing doth truly advance or innoble the ſoul but holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Job</hi> ſcraping himſelf on the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſinking in the mire, were more honorable and glorious, than <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Ahaz</hi> on their Thrones with their Crowns. If the reſpect we have from others makes us honorable, then they that are moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in Gods ſight are moſt honorable, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.4. If it be ſome internal excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie that makes men honorable, then they that have the Image of God muſt be moſt honorable.</p>
            <p>It is worthy our obſervation; that ſin is ſo ignoble and baſe, that thoſe wicked ones, who love it moſt, are aſhamed to own it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly; but becauſe of the excellencie of holineſſe, will ſet that forth for their colours, their banners, though indeed they fight Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans battels: That forlorn hope for hell, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. of covenant-breakers, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, men without natural affection, yet
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:38111:200"/> they will have a form of godlineſſe; though they do ſins drudgery, yet they are aſhamed of their baſe maſter, and therefore wear the Saints livery, <hi>having a form of godlineſſe.</hi> Nay the Devil himſelf will appear in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>'s mantle, and transform himſelf into an Angel of light.</p>
            <p>But holineſſe is ſo excellent that God is pleaſed to eſteem it as his own beauty and glory. How often is he called <hi>The holy One of Iſrael?</hi> The Angels aſcribe holineſſe to him by way of eminencie; <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Iſai.</hi> 6.3. (we read not in Scripture of any of Gods other Attributes thrice repeated, to ſhew that the Dignity of God conſiſteth in this) And ſo doe the Saints in heaven praiſe him for it as his Excellencie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.10. and the Saints on earth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. Holineſſe is the character of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>The Image of the infinitely glorious God;</hi> nay, it is called <hi>the divine nature:</hi> Surely then they that have moſt of it are moſt honorable; and they which want it, how full ſoever they are of all other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, are baſe and contemptible.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As this ſpiritual life is moſt honorable, ſo it is moſt comfortable. There
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:38111:201"/> is no life ſo pleaſant and delightful as the life of a Saint. The merry grigs, and jolly gallants of the world (whoſe ſinful mirth is worſe than madneſſe) will needs tell us, that godlineſſe makes men mopiſh and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; that when once we ſalute Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we take our leave of all delight and conſolation; whereas indeed there never was true peace born, but it had purity for its parent. All other is ſpurious and illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. But the world, like the Primitive Perſecutors, put Chriſtians into the skins of Beares and Buls, and then bait them, as if they were really ſuch. And the hand of the Devil is in all this, who like the <hi>Indians,</hi> maketh great fires to fright Mariners from landing at ſuch Coaſts as would be moſt for their comfort and contentment. Believe (Reader) the true and faithful Witneſſe, <hi>His wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſs, and all his paths are peace, Prov.</hi> 3.17. It is not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, but their want of it, or miſtake about it, which maketh them ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>It is confeſt Saints may be ſad; they doe not ceaſe to be men when they begin to be Chriſtians. It was in thy company (it may be) O ſinner: No wonder. Fiſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:38111:201"/> ſport themſelves when they are out of their element. Birds do not ſing on the ground, but when they are mounting on high towards heaven. And probably their hearts were heavy out of compaſſion to thee, whom they obſerved to be haſtening to hell, and dancing merrily over the very pit or deſtruction and eaſeleſs miſery. Thou ſeeſt their ſorrows ſometimes, thine eyes may behold their tears, but thou doſt not ſee their joys, thy heart cannot conceive them.</p>

I ſhewed him not my God, ſaith <hi>Auſtine,</hi> not becauſe I had none to ſhew, but becauſe he had no eyes to ſee him. Thus the joys of a Saint are inviſible to the wicked becauſe they are inward, ſpiritual joys, though they are joys unſpeakable and glorious. <hi>Auſtines confeſſ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have ſuch joy as thou art not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.10. They have meat to eat which thou knoweſt not of. Their life is an hidden life, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:38111:202"/> their comforts are hidden comforts; their ſecret meals fatten their ſouls, and their bread eaten in ſecret how pleaſant is it?</p>
            <p>The kingdom of God, which is this ſpiritual life, conſiſteth not in meats and drink, but in righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. And beſides, it cometh not with obſervation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.20. the world taketh no notice of it. It doth not conſiſt in the laughter of the face, in the ſmiles of the brow, but in the tranquillity of the mind, ſolid contentment in the breſt.</p>
            <p>Chriſt takes his Spouſe apart from the crowd of the world, and then gives her the ſweeteſt kiſſes, the deareſt embraces, yea her very fill of love. Many a loving viſit hath the Saint from his Saviour; when Chriſt came in at the backdoor, the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors neither ſaw when he came, nor when he went away. A true Chriſtian hath the moſt heart-chearing wine, though he hangs out no buſh, maketh no ſhew of it in the world; the wealthy Merchant that is worth thouſands, doth not cry his commodities up and down the City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The parlor wherein the ſpirit of Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains the Chriſtian, is an inner room, not next

Their mirth is like ſome juicy plumbs which have ſtones with a bitter kernel. The ſtatelieſt and beſt accommodated houſes of unſanctified men,<note place="margin">I is not the great cage that maketh the bird ſing, nor the great eſtate that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth real comfort.</note> are but like the neſts of Waſps, where there may be curious combs, but no honey; many outward mercies, but no true inward mirth, no ſweetneſs: when the voice of joy and ſalvation is in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of the righteous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.15. They onely have the ſtrong conſolations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. The joy unſpeakable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. The peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, to garriſon their hearts and minds through Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7.</p>
            <p>As they have more afflictions than others (the diſciple of Chriſt muſt take up his
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:38111:204"/> croſs) ſo they have more conſolations than others; and their ſoul comforts are not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the ſweeteſt when their bodily croſſes are greateſt (as the ſweeteſt Roſes grow neareſt the moſt ſtinking weeds) although the blind world ſee them not. As a man ſtanding, ſaith a Divine, upon the ſea-ſhore, ſeeth a great heap of waters, one wave ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the neck of another, and heareth loud roarings thereof, but though he ſeeth the waters, yet he doth not ſee the wealth, the infinite riches, that lye buried in them: So wicked men ſee the waters, the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the conflicts, but not the wealth, the comforts, the inward joy of the children of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as this ſpiritual life is the moſt honorable and comfortable, ſo it is the moſt profitable life: no calling bringeth in ſuch advantage as Chriſtianity; godlineſs is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto all things, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. There is an univerſal gainfulneſs in real godlineſs. <hi>Plutarch</hi> telleth us that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> make above three hundred ſeveral commodities of the Palme-tree; but there are many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand benefits which godlineſs bringeth; no Merchant ever had his veſſels returned
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:38111:205"/> ſo richly laden, as he that tradeth heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>Obſerve Reader, after the Apoſtles affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, his full confirmation of it. Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (ſaith he) is profitable unto all things; It hath the promiſe of this life, and that to come, <hi>i. e.</hi> It hath heaven and earth entailed on it; and therefore it muſt needs be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. It giveth the Chriſtian much in poſſeſſion, the promiſe of this life; but infinitely more in reverſion, the life that is to come.</p>
            <p>The promiſes of God are exceeding great (for their quantity) and precious (for their quality) promiſes, and they all belong to a godly man, he is called an heir of the promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. Whenſoever the tree of the Scripture is ſhaken, whatſoever fruit of thoſe precious promiſes falleth down, it falleth into the lap of a godly man. If at any time that box of coſtly ointment be broken, and ſendeth forth its fragrant ſent and vertue, it is to the refreſhment on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Saints.</p>
            <p>Godlineſs is profitable to thy ſelf; If thou art wiſe thou art wiſe for thy ſelf; and if a ſcorner thou alone ſhalt bear it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.12. The ſinner is no bodies foe ſo much as
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:38111:205"/> his own; the murdering peices of ſin which he diſchargeth againſt God, miſs their mark, but do conſtantly recoyle and wound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Saint is no bodies friend ſo much as his own; others fare the better for his great ſtock of grace; but the propriety in all the comfort of all, and the profit by all is his own. It enables him to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the more at his door, but how rich a table doth he thereby keep for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
            <p>Godlineſs is profitable for thy children: the juſt man walketh in his integrity and his children are bleſſed after him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.7. perſonal piety is profitable to poſterity, yet not of merit but mercy. Though grace come not by generation, but donation, and though God hath mercy on whom he will; yet the ſeed of the Saints are viſibly nearer the quickning influences of the ſpirit, then the children of others. When God ſaith, he will be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od to the godly man, and his children. I believe he intendeth more in that promiſe for the comfort of godly parents, then moſt of them think of. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. The children of believers are heirs apparent to the covenant of grace in their parents right; Godlineſs is profitable in
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:38111:206"/> proſperity; it giveth a ſpiritual right to temporal good things; a gracious man holdeth his mercies in <hi>capite,</hi> in Chriſt (that is his tenure) as Chriſt is a co-heir of all things, he being married to him by this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, is a co-heir with him; he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth earthly things by an heavenly title; and one peny enjoyed by ſpecial promiſe, is far more worth than millions which ungodly men enjoy by a general providence, as the beaſts of the field do their provender: It is godlineſs that cauſeth a ſanctified improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mercies. Grace alone like Chriſt turneth water into wine, corporal mercies into ſpiritual advantages. The more God oiles the wheels, the more chearfully and ſwiftly he moveth in the way to heaven; the more ſhowers of heaven fall down upon him, the more fruitful and abundant he is in the work of the Lord, as we ſee in that gracious King <hi>Iehoſophat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.5, 6. <hi>The Lord eſtabliſhed the Kingdom in his hand, and all Iudah brought preſents unto him, and he had riches and honor in abundance; and his heart was lift up in the wayes of God.</hi> Mark, the more Gods hand was enlarged in bounty, the more his heart was enlarged in duty. The more highly God thinks of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:38111:206"/> 
               <hi>David,</hi> the more lowly he thought of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18. Outward mercies to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever are a ladder by which he mounteth up nearer to heaven. Thus godlineſs like the Philoſophers ſtone, turneth iron and every thing into gold; but the want of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life cauſeth a curſed helliſh uſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; ungodly men like the ſpider ſuck poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of thoſe flowers, out of which the Bees, the Saints ſuck honey. Their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are like cordials to a foul ſtomach, which do but increaſe the peccant humor. He feedeth on ſuch plenty that he ſurfeits himſelf, becauſe of their abundance, <hi>Job</hi> 21.7, 8, 9, to 14. Therefore they ſay unto the Almighty, Depart from us, for we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not the knowledge of thy wayes; like the Iſraelites, they make of the jewels which God giveth, a golden Calf and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that in ſtead of God.</p>
            <p>Godlineſs is profitable in adverſity; it maketh a Chriſtian like a Rabbit, to thrive the better in froſty weather. The child of God learneth the better for the rod; Before he was afflicted he went aſtray, but now he keepeth Gods word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.67. Well may grace be called the divine nature, for
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:38111:207"/> it can bring not onely light out of light, ſpiritual comfort and good out of outward good things, but alſo light out of darkneſs, good out of evil, gain out of loſſes, life out of death. It will like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> fetch meat out of the eater like the Oſtrich di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſtones, like <hi>Mithridates</hi> fetch nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of poiſon. When wicked men like <hi>Ahaz</hi> in their diſtreſs, ſin more againſt the Lord; as fire the more it is kept in, in an Oven, the more it rageth, ſo doth corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but godly men far otherwiſe are by the fire of affliction the more refined and purified for their maſters uſe.</p>
            <p>Godlineſs is profitable to thee while thou liveſt; In doubts it will direct thee as a light to thy feet, and a lanthorn to thy paths; In dangers it will protect thee, by ſetting thee on high, and giving thee for a place of defence the munition of rocks; in wants it will ſupply thee by affording thee bread in the word, when thou haſt none on the boord; and money in the promiſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. (which is by thouſands the better) when thou haſt none in thy purſe; in thy pain it will eaſe thee; in diſgrace It will honor thee; in ſorrows it will comfort thee; in ſickneſs it will ſtrengthen, by cauſing thee
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:38111:207"/> to count the croſſes of this life as nothing, and unworthy to be compared to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and glory which ſhall revealed; in all diſtreſſes it will ſupport thee, and make thee more then a conqueror over all, through him that loveth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, godlineſs will be profitable to thee when thou dieſt; death which is the terrible of terribles to others, will be the comfortable of comfortables to thee. Thou needeſt never fear ill news in thine ears, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt and grace in thy heart; others ſhall not be ſuch unſpeakable looſers by death, but thou ſhalt be as great a gainer.</p>
            <p>When thou lieſt on thy death bed (where all thy friends and riches, and earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts will fail thee) this ſpiritual life is the good part which ſhall never be taken from thee) Thou maiſt look upward, and ſee (as it were) God ſmiling on thee in the face of Chriſt, and hear him call to his angels to go and fetch thee his childe (who haſt been all this while at nurſe) home to the fathers houſe. Thou mayſt look downward on thy relations, and with much faith and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs commit thy fatherleſs children to God, and bid thy weeping widdow truſt in him,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:38111:208"/> who will be infinitely better to them than ten thouſand of the richeſt tendereſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and husbands in the world. Thou maiſt look without thee into Scripture, and behold it as a garden full of ſweet flowers, comforting cordials, refreſhing, heart-revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promiſes; and though it be an incloſure to others, its open and free to thee; thou maiſt pick and chooſe, cull and gather where thou pleaſeſt, and needſt not fear to be chidden. In the multitude of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing thoughts which at that time may be within thee. thou mayeſt finde choice comforts there to refreſh thy ſpirit. If thou look within thee, thou ſhalt not have thy conſcience like an unquiet wife frowning on thee, and ſcolding at thee; but thou ſhalt hear a little bird ſinging merrily and ſweetly in thy breaſt, <hi>Lord, Now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace according to thy word, for mine eyes have ſeeen thy ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How joyful maiſt thou leave thy deareſt wife, to go to thine infinitely dearer hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? How willingly maiſt thou forſake thy lovely children, to go to thy loving God and Father? How freely maiſt thou part with all thy friends, honors, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to go to the Congregation of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:38111:208"/> firſt-born, thoſe rivers of pleaſures, and eternal weight of glory! How chearfully maiſt thou bid adieu to nothing for all things, to ſtars and ſtreams (at beſt) for a full, immediate, eternal enjoyment of the Sun himſelf, of an immenſe Ocean of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs! With what a lively colour in thy face and true comfort in thy heart maiſt thou behold that pale-faced meſſenger death (the thought of whom though a far off is death to others) entering into thy Chamber, and coming up to thy bed-ſide, how heartily welcome maiſt thou bid him, as knowing that he cometh purpoſely to give thee actual poſſeſſion of fulneſs of joy, unſpeakable delights, a Kingdom of glory that is eternal in the heavens! O the gain of godlineſs, the profit of piety, ſurely the price of this pearl is ſcarce known in this world!</p>
            <p>A Merchant will in a morning gain five hundred pound by a bargain, whereas poor people work hard a whole day for a ſhilling; ſuch a rich trade driveth the godly man; godlineſſe brings in thouſands and millions at a clap, when the moral and civil, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified man may work hard, and yet earn but ſome poor buſineſſe, ſome outward
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:38111:209"/> bleſſing God may give them and his eternal wrath at laſt.</p>
            <p>Now Reader, conſider, if here be not abundant encouragement for thee, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and diligently to labor for this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life. Is it not the gainfulleſt calling that ever was followed, the richeſt trade ever was driven? Why doſt thou ſpend thy ſtrength for what is not bread, and thy labor for that which will not ſatisfie? Heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to me, and eat thou that which is good, and let thy ſoul delight it ſelf in fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid to his ſervants, <hi>Hear now ye Benjamites, will the ſon of Jeſſe give you fields, and vineyards, and make you all cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of thouſands, and captains of hundreds?</hi> 1 Sam 22.7. So ſay I to thee, hearken O friend, will a ſenſual fleſhly life give thee ſuch honor, as to be the ſon of the infinite God, ſuch comfort as to drink of the pure rivers of Gods own pleaſures, and will it make thee bold at death, and confident at judgement, an heir of heaven, and ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in every condition? Can it do this? Can it give thee (as godlineſs can) ſo much in hand, and infinitely more in hope? If it can, I will give up my cauſe and leave thee
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:38111:209"/> to thy choice; but if it cannot, as doubtleſs thou art convinced, ſo (unleſſe thou art an Heathen among Chriſtians) why doſt thou labour ſo much and ſo eagerly for the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering and pleaſing thy fleſh, for the food that periſheth, and ſo little and ſo lazily for this food, which will endure unto everlaſting life?</p>
            <p>It was an excellent anſwer of one of the Martyrs, when he was offered riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors if he would recant; Do but offer me ſomewhat that is better than my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and you ſhall ſee what I will ſay to you.</p>
            <p>Reader, Could the world, or the fleſh, ſhew thee any thing that were equal, nay, that were but ten thouſand degrees inferior to Chriſt and godlineſs, thou mightſt have ſome colour for thy gratifying the fleſh, and unwillingneſs to walk after the Spirit; but when the diſproportion is ſo vaſt, that the one is not worthy in the leaſt to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the other; when the difference is as great, as between a ſea of honey and a ſpoonful of gall; a whole world of pearles and a little heap of dirt; an heaven of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and an hell of horror: Is it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable madneſs, and inexcuſable folly,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:38111:210"/> to chooſe that life which is after the fleſh, and refuſe that which is after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</p>
            <p>Reader, if thou wouldſt be truly honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the eſteem of God himſelf, who is the fountain of all honor: If thou wouldſt have thoſe ſpiritual conſolations, which can warm the heart in the coldeſt night of affliction: If thou wouldſt be profitable to thy dear children, to thy own ſoul; be a reall gainer in proſperity, in adverſity, while thou liveſt, when thou dyeſt: If thou wouldſt when thy wealth, and friends, and fleſh, and heart ſhall fail thee, have God in Chriſt to be the ſtrength of thy heart, and thy portion for ever: If thou wouldſt in thy greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, when thy ſoul ſhall be turned (naked of all earthly delights) out of thy body, eſcape the fury of roaring Devils, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable burnings: If thou wouldſt in that hour of thy miſery find mercy, and be received into the place of endleſſe bliſſe; then get this ſpiritual life, this true wiſdom, to fear God and depart from evil: Get wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, get underſtanding, forget it not; above all thy gettings get wiſdom. <hi>Happy is the man that findeth wiſdom, and the man that get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth underſtanding: For the merchandiſe of it
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:38111:210"/> is better than the merchandiſe of ſilver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than rubies, and all the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared to her. Length of dayes is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to all that lay hold upon her; and happy is every one that retaineth her,</hi> Prov. 3.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>ANd now, Reader, I have done this large Uſe of Exhortation, which is of ſuch infinite concernment to thy precious ſoul; but what thou wilt do, or what uſe thou wilt make of it, I know not. Could I have told what other holy bait to have laid, which had been more likely to have caught thy ſoul, it is probable I ſhould have la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d it. I appeal to thy conſcience, whether t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ere be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable weight, and unqueſtionable truth, in the particulars which are laid down. Well what ſayeſt thou to them, and what effect have they wrought upon thee? Art thou reſolved through the help of heaven, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:38111:211"/> and diligently to practice the directions, which I have from the Almighty God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned thee? Is it not a thouſand thouſand pities, that ſuch endleſſe, matchleſſe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould be ſo gratiouſly offered by God, and ſo unworthily neglected by men! that an empty, periſhing world ſhould be ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly purſued, and heartily embraced, when the unſearchable riches in Chriſt, the Image of the bleſſed God, eternal weight of Glory, are baſely undervalued, and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly deſpiſed! Good Lord, what teares of blood are ſufficient to bewail this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous unthankfulneſs. Friend, if thou art truly reſolved to obey the counſell of God, thou wilt have cauſe to bleſſe that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which called me to this task; and I may rejoyce in thee, and thou in me, at the day of Chriſt. But if thou either delayeſt the work till thou art more at leiſure; or dallieſt about it, doing it as if thou didſt it not, I am ſure the greateſt wrong will be to thy ſelf; for behold thou ſinneſt againſt the Lord, and be confident, thy ſins will ſooner or later find thee out.</p>
            <p>I come in the next place to my laſt Uſe, which will be of conſolation. If they who have Chriſt for their life, ſhall have gain by
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:38111:211"/> their death, what comfort is here to the new born Creature! Here is wine indeed to make glad the heart of every one that is holy. Reader, art thou ſanctified and alive in Chriſt? then thou art freed from all the miſery which is mentioned in the firſt Uſe, as the portion of the ungodly. I may ſay to thee, as <hi>Gryneus,</hi> when he had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and threatening ſinners, would, turning to the Saint, ſay; <hi>Bone vir, hoc nihil ad te,</hi> Good man, all this is nothing to thee. Though they are loſers, thou ſhalt be a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by death. Come but with the mouth of faith, and thou mayſt ſuck much honey from this combe, thou mayſt draw much milk of conſolation from this breaſt; to thee to die ſhall be gain. Surely here is enough to ballaſt thy ſoul, and keep it ſteady, in the moſt tempeſtuous condition, and to ballance and weigh down the greateſt, the heavieſt affliction.</p>

            </p>
            <p>If thou hadſt hope only in this life, thou wert of all men moſt miſerable; but becauſe thou haſt hope beyond this life, thou mayſt be of all men moſt comfortable.</p>

If an heathen could ſay, It is unbecoming a Roman ſpirit to cry out, I am undone, while <hi>Ceſar</hi> was ſafe; ſure it is more uncomely for a Chriſtian to complain, as if he were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, when his ſoul is ſafe, his eternal eſtate is ſecure.</p>
            <p>For thy help, I ſhall digeſt this Uſe into this method briefly:</p>

            <p>Secondly, wherein it is comfortable.</p>
            <p>For the firſt: It is comfortable firſt againſt the oppoſition of the world; <hi>The world will hate thee, becauſe thou art not of the world, John</hi> 15.19.

            <p>Infinite Wiſdom ſeeth fit to imbitter the breaſts of the creatures to wean thee from them.

            <p n="2">2. It is a comfort againſt the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Devil. Whilſt thou liveſt in this world, thou art liable to his wiles. If thou wilt go to heaven, ſo boundleſs is his malice, that he raiſeth all the powers of hell againſt thee, and forceth thee to fight every foot of the way.

But for thee who haſt by the help of Chriſt broken priſon, and in part got out of his power, he raiſeth all the Country with Hue and cry to bring thee back to thy old place of bondage.

And it is as true of the day of death, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to every particular Saint. As when a man dyeth, all thoſe vexatious law-ſuits, with which he was before moleſted, do ceaſe: So when the believer dyeth, all thoſe falſe actions which Satan had commenced againſt him in the court of his conſcience, and all that inward trouble which did ariſe thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do all ceaſe.</p>

            <p>It is no bad ſign now, O Chriſtian, (if thou reſiſteſt) that thou art aſſaulted by the wicked one. A Theif will not break into an houſe that is empty. A Pirate will not fight but for ſome conſiderable prize. A Father will not ſeek to deſtroy his own Children. Temptation is no ſign of Gods hatred but of the Devils: But let this be thy ſolace, that within a few dayes thou ſhalt be at reſt, not only from thy own labours, but alſo from Satans ſnares and ſuggeſtions. God doth thee much good by them now; the noiſe of thoſe guns cauſeth the Conies to haſten to their burrowes, and the Birds to their places of refuge. The more the tops of ſound trees are ſhaken with the wind, the more deeply their roots are fixed in the earth: the more eagerly Satan followeth thee, the faſter thou flieſt, and the cloſer thou clingeſt to Jeſus Chriſt. But God will do thee the greateſt good without them; and when that ſhall be, thou ſhalt be wholly freed from them. Since the Devils were caſt out of Heaven, we read of their being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Sea, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.33. ſometimes in the Earth, <hi>Job</hi> 1.7. and ſometimes in the Air, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. and they are called Principalities and ſpiritual wickedneſſes in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:38111:215"/> high places, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. but never in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They aſpire to get as high as they can, but they can get no further than the Air; Satan and his Angels find no more place in heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.8.</p>
            <p>Now what comfort is this, O Chriſtian, that thou ſhalt ſerve the Lord without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, without temptations?</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is comfortable againſt the corruptions of thine own heart. What is it now that is thy greateſt ſorrow? Is it not thy ſin? Theſe are the weights which hang on the clock of thy heart, and will not ſuffer it to reſt day or night. Well, rejoyce in hope; at death all theſe <hi>Achans,</hi> which are the troublers of thy peace, ſhall be ſtoned to death; all theſe <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs,</hi> which cauſe ſuch ſtormes in thy ſoul, ſhall be caſt over-board; all theſe <hi>Hamans</hi> which ſeek the ruine of thee and thy people, ſhall be executed.</p>
            <p>Now it is thy great care in every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to kill thy ſins. Doſt thou not like <hi>Joab</hi> ſet the <hi>Uriah</hi> of thy beloved luſt in the fore-front of every duty, and retire from it out of pious policy, that it may be ſlain? And when at any time it pleaſeth the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of thy ſalvation to ſend the ſupplies of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:38111:216"/> his Spirit, and wound mortally thy corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it lyeth gaſping and dying before thee; doſt thou not look up to Chriſt and ſay (as <hi>Cuſhi</hi> to <hi>David</hi> concerning dead <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom) Would to God, that all the enemies of my Lord the King, and all that riſe againſt thee to do thee hurt were as that young man is.</hi> Lord, that all my ſins might drink of the ſame cup, and be ſerved the ſame ſauce. Bleſſed be the Lord my God, which hath avenged me this day of mine enemy. If God ſhould thruſt the knife of mortification up to the haft, in the very hearts of all thy ſins, that thou couldſt ſee thy pride, diſtruſt, unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, hardneſſe of heart, and every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in a goar-blood, fetching their laſt breath, would it not be a lovely ſight to thee? Wouldſt thou not look upon it, with as much content as <hi>Hannibal</hi> did upon a pit full of the blood of men, when he cried out, O beautiful ſight?<note place="margin">O formo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum ſpecta culum!</note> Or as that Queen, that cried out, when ſhe ſaw her Subjects lie dead before her eyes, The goodlieſt tapeſtry that ever ſhe beheld? At death all this ſhall be done for thee. One touch of Jeſus Chriſt at death will quite dry up that iſſue of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Death will give thee a Writ of eaſe from all thoſe weights and ſins which

            <p>Will it not indeed be a brave world with thee in the other world, when thou ſhalt have as much holineſs as thy heart can wiſh or hold? If God ſhould grant thee ſuch a requeſt upon earth, that thou ſhouldſt have as much of his Image and of his Spirit as thou couldſt deſire, wouldſt thou not think thy ſelf the happieſt man alive? I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident thou wouldſt; and alſo that nothing leſſe than perfect purity would be thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Well, death will help thee to this; <hi>When I awake I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> Pſal. 17. ult.</p>
            <p>Now thou haſt enough to ſtay thy ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, but then thou ſhalt have a full meal. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Canaan,</hi> there was not one feeble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon among them.

Thou needſt not fear death as a foe, it will be one of thy beſt friends.

            <p>Beſides canſt thou think that the Lord Jeſus would humble himſelf to ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible birth, live ſuch a miſerable life, dye ſuch a lamentable painful death, to purchaſe low mean things or any thing leſs then emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, excellent, unſpeakable, unconceivable happineſs?</p>

And many more expreſſions doth the ſpirit of God uſe to deſcribe the excellency of the Saints hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and why in ſuch variety of phraſes, but to aſſure us that whatſoever is requiſite or deſirable in order <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o happineſs it is there? the holy Ghoſt doth gather as it were a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the moſt ſweet beautiful pleaſant choice flowers that grow in the whole gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of this world, and telleth us, this is heaven. Do but abſtract all the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that attend the riches, and honor, and pleaſures of earthly kindoms, and they may be dark reſemblances that ſhadow out the glory and excellency of the heavenly kingdom. The Philoſophers could ſay, That happineſs muſt conſiſt in ſuch a ſtate wherein was an aggregation of all good things: So that though a man had all good things, and wanted but one, he could not be called an happy man; therefore in Scripture the Hebrew word for happineſs is in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number,<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:38111:223"/> that it hath all deſireable good things.</p>
            <p>Reader, when thou art feeding on all thoſe glorious deſcriptions of heaven that are ſet before thee on the table of the Scripture, do not ſwallow them all together, but chew them ſeverally, and thou maiſt get much ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual nouriſhment out of them. As for example, It is called the joy of thy Lord, or the Maſters joy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21. Now what joy muſt that be? What infinite unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable joy hath the bleſſed God, the fountain of all joy, and the God of all conſolations! Thou ſhalt partake of the very ſame joy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy capacity; Thou ſhalt ſit at the ſame table, drink of the ſame cup, and feed on the ſame dainties with his Majeſty. Can it then enter into thy heart to imagine either the pureneſs or fulneſs of thy Lords joy? Is not the beſt joy of the ſervants on earth ſorrow, and their greateſt mirth mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to the Maſters joy in heaven? <hi>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord;</hi> a joy too big to enter into us, we muſt enter into it. A joy more meet for the Lord then the ſervant; yet ſuch a Lord do we ſerve as will honor his ſervants with his own joy.</p>
            <p>Again, it is called a City whoſe builder
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:38111:224"/> and maker is God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.10. Hence thou maiſt gather, That ſtructure muſt be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful indeed which hath ſuch a builder; what a glorious fabricke muſt that be which hath ſuch a workman as he is, who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite richneſs to adorn, infinite bounty to beſtow, and infinite power to erect? what a City muſt that be? If poor mortals can ſet up ſuch ſtately buildings, what a place, what a palace muſt that be, whoſe builder and maker is God?</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is called the fathers houſe; here I might expatiate, and tell thee, that great Princes have great ſeats often for their ſervants, but they have glorious ones indeed for themſelves; In their own houſes they manifeſt all their wealth and worth, their bounty and bravery, their honor and magnificence. What an houſe then hath the King of kings for his manſion houſe? If the ſeveral excellencies of all the Princes palaces in the world were united in one, ſuppoſe it had the foundations of marble, the floors of pearl, the cielings of wrought gold; all the varieties of <hi>Babel,</hi> the glory of <hi>Solomons</hi> houſe, the richneſs of the temple at Jeruſalem; ſuppoſe it had the ſtatelieſt rooms, the pleaſanteſt muſick, the greateſt
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:38111:224"/> dainties, the richeſt furniture, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior world could afford; ſuppoſe all the choice perfections of the whole creation here below, were extracted, and the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of them all beſtowed upon it, yet after all this it would be but like an houſe of dirt made by children, in compariſon of the fathers houſe, of that houſe not made with hands but eternal in the heavens. But Chriſtian, I leave theſe titles to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and enlarged in thy own meditations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is comfortable if thou conſidereſt the certainty of it. It is not onely excellent but certain; though it were never ſo excellent, yet if it were not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it would be but little comfort; but know to the joy of thine heart, that as heaven is a place of unſpeakable excellency, ſo thy enjoyment of it (O new-born creature) is of unqueſtionable certainty. It is worthy our admiration, how many wayes the moſt high God (out of condeſcention to our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and compaſſion to our infirmities) doth confirm and enſure this gain by death to believers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By his promiſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.22. <hi>Fear not little flock, it is your fathers pleaſure to give you

Thou wouldſt take the word of a good man, and wilt thou not take the word of a God? But wonder at his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; he tendereth further ſecurity by his oath, nay by the greateſt oath imaginable; having no greater to ſwear by, he ſware by himſelf, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By his Seals; we have the broad Seal of Heaven, the Seals of the Covenant, to confirm this to us: The Sacraments are ſeals of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. And we have the privy Seal of the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. So that if the hand and ſeal of a God will do it, Heaven is enſured to all that are ſanctified.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By an earneſt, that makes a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſure: <hi>Who hath ſealed us, and given the earneſt of the ſpirit in our hearts,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt went from us, he left his Spirit with us, to aſſure us, that he would

            <p>Thirdly, it is comfortable if thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt the eternity of it. Though it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo excellent and certain, yet if it were for a ſhort time only, it would afford but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle comfort. Nay, the greater our joy were in the poſſeſſion of it, the greater our ſorrow would be in our ſeparation from it. The very thought of ever loſing ſuch incomparable happineſs would be a deep wound to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians heart, and without queſtion abate much of his joy whilſt he did enjoy it. Nothing leſſe than eternity can perfect the Saints fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; And lo here it is; thy gain is not only of unſpeakable excellency, and unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble certainty, but alſo durable even unto eternity.</p>

            <p>The joy of the ſinner is like the crackling of thorns under a pot; it may make a buſling noiſe, but quickly goeth out; but the joy of a Saint will be like the fire upon the Altar, which never goeth out day nor night: <hi>Their joy ſhall no man take from them,</hi> John 16.</p>
            <p>The glory of a Chriſtian there, will be an eternal weight of glory: the ſhame of a Chriſtian here is tranſitory, like a cloud up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the Sun, which will ſoon be ſcattered; and the honor of a graceleſs man here is ſhort like a fleeting ſhadow;<note n="*" place="margin">Tacitus</note> as <hi>Seja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was one day adored like a God, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after with the greateſt ignominy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Goal.

            <p>O what a long day will eternity be to the

            <p>Reader, if thou art in Chriſt, ponder much in time, the eternity of pleaſure which is prepared for thee.

            <p>Mortality is a flaw in all earthly tenures, which abateth their price, and imbittereth their pleaſures; but eternity is a diamond which ſparkleth moſt radiantly in the crown of glory, and maketh it beyond all expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or compariſon weighty.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian, how may this perſwade thee to be exact in thy walking with God, when in doing of his commands there is ſuch great reward?
